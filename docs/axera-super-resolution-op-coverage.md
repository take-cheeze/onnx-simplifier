# Op coverage for training super-resolution models on the AX650N: a survey

Companion to `docs/axera-on-device-training-handoff.md` (resnet18/50) and
`docs/axera-audio-speech-op-coverage.md` (Whisper/wav2vec2/LSTM/GRU), same
question for a new domain: for a real single-image super-resolution (SISR)
architecture, which ops does today's pipeline
(`onnxsim.graph_grad.build_backward` + `scripts/axera/legalize.py`'s
`TRAINING_RULES`) already reach, and which have a real, specific gap?
Cross-referenced against the same two tables every other survey in this
project uses: `onnxsim.graph_grad._RULES`/`_PYTHON_ONLY_RULES`/
`_MULTI_OUTPUT_RULES` (what `build_backward` can differentiate) and
`scripts/axera/pulsar2_ops.py`'s `AX650_SUPPORTED_OPS` (what the NPU can run
at all).

## A real architecture: EDSR

`pip install super-image` (pulls in `torch`, `torchvision`,
`opencv-python`, `h5py`, `huggingface-hub`; export only, no dataset or
pretrained weights needed) ships a real library of published SISR
architectures behind a HuggingFace-`transformers`-style config/model API --
EDSR, CARN, MSRN, PAN, RCAN, DRLN, HAN, and others, each its own
`<Name>Config`/`<Name>Model` pair. **EDSR** ("Enhanced Deep Residual
Networks for Single Image Super-Resolution", Lim et al. 2017) is the
natural first target: one of the field's foundational architectures, and
its own code (`super_image.models.edsr.modeling_edsr`) is about as simple
as a real SISR network gets -- a head `Conv`, `n_resblocks` residual blocks
(each two `Conv`s + `ReLU`, plain `res = body(x); res += x`), and a tail
`Upsampler` (a `Conv` widening channels by `scale**2`, then
`nn.PixelShuffle(scale)` -- the sub-pixel convolution every architecture in
this library's own `Upsampler`/`MeanShift` shared utility uses for
upsampling) before a final color-channel `Conv`.

Exported at a tiny config (`scale=2`, `n_resblocks=2`, `n_feats=8`, a
16x16 input) via `scripts/axera/build_edsr_train_step.py`'s
`export_edsr()`, real (random-initialized, not pretrained) weights:

| op types present | in `_RULES`/`_PYTHON_ONLY_RULES`? |
| --- | --- |
| `Conv`, `Add`, `Relu`, `Mul`, `Constant` | yes (`Constant` folds away entirely at `build_resident_step()`'s own constant-folding step, since `res_scale=1.0`'s `Mul` collapses to a no-op) |
| `DepthToSpace` | **no** (until this survey) |

**Every op except one is already covered on both axes.** `Conv`/`Add`/
`Relu`/`Mul` all have `graph_grad` backward rules and are NPU-executable
(confirmed directly, the same two-table lookup every other survey here
does) -- residual-block training was never in question. `DepthToSpace`
(`nn.PixelShuffle`'s exact ONNX form, `mode="CRD"` -- what
`torch.onnx.export` always emits for it) was the one real gap: **already
NPU-executable** (unlike `GRU`'s own stricter gap), just missing a backward
rule.

## Fixed: `onnxsim.graph_grad._grad_depth_to_space`

`DepthToSpace` is ONNX's own spec-documented `reshape -> transpose ->
reshape`, nothing else -- a pure element permutation, no learned or
run-time-dependent component. Its adjoint is therefore the same chain run
backward: reshape the incoming gradient into the *post-transpose* shape,
transpose by the *inverse* permutation, reshape to the input's own shape --
`Reshape`'s and `Transpose`'s own adjoints, both already in `BACKWARD_OPS`
and already registered rules (`_grad_reshape`/`_grad_transpose`), just
inlined here rather than called since the intermediate tensor never
otherwise exists as a named node in the graph.

**Verified directly against real onnxruntime execution, not derived from
the spec text alone** -- the same discipline this project's LSTM/GRU work
established after an initial `GRU` `linear_before_reset` assumption came
out backwards (off by up to `0.48`) on a first attempt. A dot-product test
(`sum(g * y)`'s gradient via central-difference finite differences, `eps=
1e-3`) against a real, `onnxruntime`-executed native `DepthToSpace` node
agreed to `5.7e-4` -- within that tolerance, and confirmed for both
`mode="CRD"` (what `nn.PixelShuffle` exports) and `mode="DCR"`
(TensorFlow's own convention, covered too since a wrong mode branch would
fail silently, not loudly). Registered in a new `_PYTHON_ONLY_RULES` entry
(no C++/WASM mirror yet, the same "real rule, missing port" situation
`Concat`/`Where`/`IsNaN` are already in that table for) and exercised as
two of `tests/test_graph_grad.py`'s own finite-difference cases
(`depth_to_space_crd`/`depth_to_space_dcr`).

## Host-verified: a real EDSR resident training step

`scripts/axera/build_edsr_train_step.py` builds the full pipeline every
other model in this project uses (`add_mse_loss_nchw` -- the rank-4
`[N,C,H,W]` counterpart of `build_resident_train_step.add_mse_loss`'s
rank-2 and `build_whisper_train_step.add_loss_3d`'s rank-3 versions, same
explicit-`axes` `ReduceMean` guard against the AX650's own bare-`ReduceMean`
vendor bug -- then `build_resident_train_step.build_resident_step()`
unchanged), at three trainable scopes:

- `tail` (4 tensors: the upsampler's widening `Conv` + the final
  color-channel `Conv`) -- the most direct exercise of
  `_grad_depth_to_space`, since a gradient must pass through
  `DepthToSpace` immediately to reach the widening `Conv`'s weight.
- `head` (2 tensors: the very first `Conv`) -- the harder scope, requiring
  a gradient through `DepthToSpace`, *and* every residual block, to reach
  it.
- `all` (16 tensors: every trainable weight in the network).

All three build and pass `onnx.checker.check_model` cleanly (68/91/232
nodes respectively) -- `build_backward` reaches every target tensor in
every scope, `head` included, confirming the fix works through the whole
network's depth, not just locally around `DepthToSpace` itself. See
"Real hardware: confirmed, with a real generalizable backend bug found
along the way" below for the real compile/train result and a real, new
Pulsar2 limitation this surfaced.

**One real naming gotcha, worth recording generically**: `EdsrModel`'s own
input is naturally named `"lr"` (**l**ow-**r**esolution) in an
export -- colliding silently with this pipeline's own reserved `"lr"`
(**l**earning **r**ate) scalar that `build_resident_step()` always adds.
`onnxsim.simplify()`'s SSA check is what actually catches the collision
(`'lr' has been used as graph input names multiple times`), well
downstream of the export call itself, not at export time. Renamed to
`"lowres"` in `build_edsr_train_step.py`; worth checking for by name in any
future domain whose own natural input name happens to collide with this
pipeline's small reserved vocabulary (`lr`, `grad_seed`, `lowres`'s own
`hr` counterpart is fine since nothing else claims it yet).

## Real hardware: confirmed, with a real generalizable backend bug found along the way

`scripts/axera/build_edsr_calib.py` follows `build_parakeet_lstm_calib.py`'s
established real-data-calibration recipe exactly (a real host float32 SGD
trajectory for every trainable tensor, `lr` jittered around the value that
trajectory actually used, `grad_seed` given real values near 1.0) and
compiled the `tail` scope with real `pulsar2:7.0-lite`.

**A new, real, generalizable Pulsar2 NPU-backend limitation, not an EDSR
quirk -- found, then fixed**: compiling `tail`'s full 4-tensor scope (both
`Conv` weights and both biases) originally failed --
`TileFailException("AxQuantizedSub, tuple index out of range")` on the
in-graph SGD update (`w_next = w - lr * grad`, an ordinary `Sub`) for a
**rank-1** operand. Confirmed on two different real compiles, isolating
the trigger precisely: `tail.1.bias` (3 elements) and `tail.0.0.bias` (32
elements) both crashed identically, so element count was not the cause --
rank was. **Every earlier real-hardware training in this project's
history happened to only train rank>=2 weight tensors** -- resnet18/50's
conv/fc weights, LSTM/GRU's per-gate weight matrices -- which is almost
certainly why this was never found before EDSR's own survey put a bias
tensor directly in a trainable scope for the first time.

**Fixed generically in `build_resident_step()` itself** (not an
EDSR-specific patch): any rank-1 trainable tensor's whole per-step update
now runs in rank-2 `[1, N]` space -- reshape in, `Mul`/`Sub`, reshape back
-- transparent to the state tensor's own declared rank-1 shape at the
step graph's I/O boundary, so calibration and every other caller see the
exact same tensor shapes as before (the `fetch_calibration_data`
`IndexError` an earlier attempt at this hit turned out to be an artifact
of that attempt's own approach, not a real blocker of the reshape
strategy itself -- calibrating the unchanged rank-1 I/O boundary directly,
as `build_edsr_calib.py` already did, needed no special handling at all).
Verified bit-exact against the un-reshaped math on host, and a dedicated
regression test (`tests/test_build_resident_train_step.py`'s
`test_rank1_state_update_is_reshaped_around_the_sub`) checks both the
structural property (`Sub` never sees a bare rank-1 operand) and the
numeric one (the implied gradient matches a central-difference check of
the original graph, independent of `build_resident_step`'s own code).

**Real numbers, `--scope tail --weights-only` (`tail.0.0.weight` +
`tail.1.weight`, 58 nodes)**: compiles in **~30 seconds** (three real
compiles: 29.7s/29.8s/30.2s), consistent with `unroll_lstm`/`unroll_gru`'s
own "no compile-time blowup" finding. Real hardware, `lr=1.0`: real,
monotonically decreasing loss (`0.0956074 -> 0.0948575 -> 0.0937327 ->
... -> 0.0892335` over 30 real steps, ~144 steps/s), confirmed genuinely
gradient-driven via the standard control -- the identical input at
`lr=0` freezes bit-identical across 10 real steps. `lr=0.1` (this
tensor's own real gradient magnitude is not tiny -- `~3.5e-4`/`~2.1e-3`
mean `|grad|` for the two weights, measured directly) still rounds to
zero under real INT8 quantization at that scale; `lr=10` diverges to NaN
within a handful of real host SGD steps. `lr=1.0` is the confirmed
working value, not a default guess.

**With the rank-1 fix in place, `--scope tail` (all four tensors, both
`Conv` weights and both biases, 72 nodes) now also compiles and trains on
real hardware**: real `pulsar2:7.0-lite` build in **31.2s** (no
compile-time cost from the extra reshapes), and real, monotonically
decreasing loss at `lr=1.0` (`0.0914259 -> 0.0910601 -> 0.0906944 -> ... ->
0.0895973` over 30 real steps, ~136 steps/s), confirmed genuinely
gradient-driven via the same `lr=0` control (bit-identical loss across 10
real steps). Bias tensors are trainable through this pipeline now, not
just a documented future direction.

**A second real gap found and fixed getting here, worth recording
generically**: `export_edsr()`'s first version never seeded `torch`, so
every export gave every *frozen* (non-trainable) tensor a fresh random
value -- and since a trainable tensor's real gradient depends on every
frozen tensor between it and the loss, two outwardly-identical
compile+run attempts (differing only in which unseeded export produced
the `.axmodel`) showed real training at one and a fully frozen loss at
the other. Not a calibration or backend bug -- a genuinely different real
network each time. Fixed with `torch.manual_seed(0)`; the numbers above
are reproducible run to run with it in place.

## What's next

Beyond EDSR itself: `super-image`'s other architectures (CARN, MSRN, PAN,
RCAN, DRLN, HAN, ...) share the same `Upsampler`/`MeanShift` utility module
EDSR does, so the same `DepthToSpace` coverage almost certainly transfers
directly -- untried here, but a much smaller lift than EDSR's own first
survey was, since the one real gap this domain has is now closed.

The rank-1 `AxQuantizedSub` crash found above was not EDSR-specific --
any future domain training a bias tensor through this pipeline's in-graph
SGD update would have hit it too. Already fixed generically in
`build_resident_step()` itself (see "Real hardware" above), so no future
domain needs its own per-model workaround the way `trainable_scope`'s
`weights_only` flag did here before the fix.

# DLPack tensor exchange at the constant-folding executor boundary

## Why

onnxsim's constant folder repeatedly builds a throwaway sub-model for each
"fold group" and asks a `ModelExecutor` to evaluate it. Historically that
boundary exchanged tensors as `onnx::TensorProto`:

```cpp
// old
virtual std::vector<onnx::TensorProto> _Run(
    const onnx::ModelProto& model,
    const std::vector<onnx::TensorProto>& inputs) const = 0;
```

That representation forces a protobuf materialization on both sides of every
executor call. The worst offender was the output path (`TensorToTensorProto`),
which appended results **element by element** with `add_float_data(dptr[i])`,
reallocating the repeated field as it grew — far more expensive than a memcpy.
The input path copied too (`TensorProtoToTensor` allocated an ORT buffer and
memcpy'd into it, after copying each initializer into the feed vector).

Two goals motivated moving the boundary to DLPack:

1. **Avoid the TensorProto tax** on the hot folding path — borrow buffers in,
   move ORT's own output buffers out.
2. **Embeddability.** onnxsim can be dropped into another ONNX-based compiler or
   runtime stack (a different ORT build, IREE, TVM, a hardware vendor runtime)
   by having that host implement *one* executor callback that speaks a standard
   tensor ABI, without ever touching `onnx::TensorProto` or the vendored ORT.

DLPack (`DLManagedTensor`) is that ABI. It is a small, stable C struct — data
pointer, device, dtype, shape, strides, deleter — usable identically in native
builds, WebAssembly, and across an FFI. Nothing about it is Python-specific.

## The boundary

```cpp
// onnxsim.h
struct ModelExecutor {
  virtual ~ModelExecutor() = default;
  virtual std::vector<DLManagedTensorPtr> Run(
      const onnx::ModelProto& model,
      const std::vector<const DLManagedTensor*>& inputs) const = 0;
};
```

- **Positional, not named.** `inputs[i]` feeds `model.graph().input(i)`; the
  result has one tensor per `model.graph().output()`, in order. DLPack has no
  name field, and `RunOps` already relied on positional order, so nothing is
  lost.
- **`DLManagedTensorPtr`** is `std::unique_ptr<DLManagedTensor,
  DLManagedTensorDeleter>`; releasing it invokes the tensor's own DLPack
  `deleter` exactly once. Ownership is therefore RAII on the C++ side and an
  explicit deleter contract at the C ABI.

### Ownership / lifetime contract

- **Inputs are borrowed** for the duration of the call. The executor must not
  free them or retain them past return. onnxsim keeps the backing buffers
  (initializer `raw_data`) alive across the call.
- **Outputs are freshly owned** by the caller. Each carries a `deleter` that
  releases whatever the producer attached — a borrowed-buffer no-op, an
  `Ort::Value`, or a host allocation.
- All tensors at this boundary are **CPU (`kDLCPU`), contiguous, and
  little-endian**.

### What stays `TensorProto`

The **model** still crosses as a serialized `ModelProto` — ONNX initializers are
inherently protobuf, and the sub-model is tiny. Only the **runtime feeds and
fetches** become DLPack. Likewise, folded results are ultimately baked back into
the model as `raw_data` initializers; that final write is the one unavoidable
copy (`ToTensorProto`, a single `set_raw_data`).

## dtype mapping

`dlpack_dtype.h` maps the stable ONNX dtype wire numbers to `DLDataType` and
back, bijectively, with `lanes == 1`. It depends only on `dlpack.h` (not the
onnx headers), so it is unit-tested standalone (`dlpack_dtype_test`).

| ONNX dtype | DLDataType (code, bits) | bytes |
|------------|--------------------------|-------|
| FLOAT16    | kDLFloat, 16             | 2     |
| FLOAT      | kDLFloat, 32             | 4     |
| DOUBLE     | kDLFloat, 64             | 8     |
| BFLOAT16   | kDLBfloat, 16            | 2     |
| INT8       | kDLInt, 8                | 1     |
| INT16      | kDLInt, 16               | 2     |
| INT32      | kDLInt, 32               | 4     |
| INT64      | kDLInt, 64               | 8     |
| UINT8      | kDLUInt, 8               | 1     |
| UINT16     | kDLUInt, 16              | 2     |
| UINT32     | kDLUInt, 32              | 4     |
| UINT64     | kDLUInt, 64              | 8     |
| BOOL       | kDLBool, 8               | 1     |

Rejected at this boundary (no contiguous little-endian layout the folder
exchanges): STRING, COMPLEX64/128, FLOAT8\*, INT4/UINT4/FLOAT4, UNDEFINED. This
matches — and slightly extends (adds FLOAT16/BFLOAT16/UINT32) — the dtype set the
old TensorProto↔ORT converters handled.

## Adapters

One boundary, several adapters (`dlpack_bridge.h` holds the conversions):

| Adapter | Where | Input | Output | Copies |
|---------|-------|-------|--------|--------|
| `CppModelExecutor` | onnxsim.cpp (built-in ORT) | `BorrowAsOrtValue` wraps the feed buffer via ORT's borrowing `CreateTensor` — **zero copy** | `FromOrtValue` moves ORT's own output buffer into the managed tensor — **zero copy** | none at the boundary |
| `CApiModelExecutor` | capi/onnxsim_c_api.cpp | host receives borrowed `DLManagedTensor*` | host returns owned `DLManagedTensor*`, released via their deleters | host's choice |
| `PyModelExecutor` | cpp2py_export.cc | `ToTensorProto` → bytes | bytes → `FromTensorProtoOwning` | protobuf round trip (see below) |
| `XnnpackModelExecutor` | xnnpack_executor.cpp (`ONNXSIM_BUILTIN_XNNPACK`) | feed pointers passed straight to `xnn_setup_runtime_v2` as `xnn_external_value`s — **zero copy** | XNNPACK writes into an executor-allocated `std::vector<float>` (it has no ORT-style "hand back the session's buffer" mode) — **one copy at the boundary** (allocation, not a memcpy) | one allocation per output |

### XNNPACK: an explicitly-partial backend, not a drop-in ORT replacement

`GetXnnpackModelExecutor()` (`onnxsim/xnnpack_executor.h` declares it, guarded
by `ONNXSIM_HAS_XNNPACK`) runs fold groups through Google's
[XNNPACK](https://github.com/google/XNNPACK) instead of ONNX Runtime, going
through XNNPACK's own graph-level **Subgraph API**
(`xnn_create_subgraph`/`xnn_define_*`/`xnn_create_runtime_v4`) rather than its
per-operator kernel API. `onnxsim/onnx_to_xnnpack_subgraph.{h,cpp}` is the
ONNX-ModelProto-to-`xnn_subgraph_t` lowering; `onnxsim/xnnpack_executor.cpp`
is the `ModelExecutor` adapter that creates a runtime from the result, feeds
it the call's `inputs`, invokes it, and wraps the outputs as
`DLManagedTensor`s.

Unlike `CppModelExecutor`, which delegates to ORT and so handles essentially
any ONNX op, this lowering supports only a small, explicit op set — see
`onnx_to_xnnpack_subgraph.h`'s `kSupportedOps`. `Lower()` throws
`std::runtime_error` naming the reason for anything outside that: an
unsupported op, an unsupported tensor dtype, `Gemm` with `alpha != 1` or
`transA != 0`, a `Reshape` target shape that is itself produced by another
node in the fold group rather than being a constant or a feed, and so on.
Notably absent is `Conv`: XNNPACK's convolution Node is NHWC-native while
ONNX's is NCHW, and getting that layout conversion (activations *and* the
OIHW→OHWI weight transpose) right needs more verification than this first
cut has had — left as follow-up work rather than shipped un-verified.

Most of the op set is fp32 only: `Add`/`Sub`/`Mul`/`Div`, `Relu`, `Sigmoid`,
`Gemm`/`MatMul` (2D operands only), `Reshape` (static target shape only).
`QuantizeLinear`, `DequantizeLinear`, and `QLinearMatMul` additionally
support standard ONNX int8/uint8 quantization, mapped onto XNNPACK's own
quantized datatypes (`qint8`/`quint8`/`qcint8`) — `QuantizeLinear`/
`DequantizeLinear` lower to an `xnn_unary_convert` Node bridging an fp32
Value and a quantized one; `QLinearMatMul` (no float in between; a's/b's/
y's own quantized Values feed `xnn_define_fully_connected` directly, the
same Node Gemm/MatMul use) supports `b` quantized per-tensor or per-column.
Scope is deliberately narrower here too: per-tensor only for
`QuantizeLinear`/`DequantizeLinear` and `QLinearMatMul`'s output, symmetric
(`zero_point == 0`) only for per-channel quantization (XNNPACK's per-channel
datatypes don't have a per-channel zero-point parameter at the API surface
this lowering uses), and no `com.microsoft` contrib ops (`QGemm`,
`QLinearConv`, `QLinearAdd`, ...) — only standard ONNX.

One correctness trap worth flagging for anyone extending this further:
`xnn_define_channelwise_quantized_tensor_value` stores its `scale` array as
a bare pointer (read again whenever a runtime is created from the
subgraph), not a copy — unlike `dims`, which it does copy. A per-channel
scale array therefore needs the same "outlive the subgraph and any runtime
built from it" lifetime as tensor data does (see
`LoweredSubgraph::owned_scale_arrays`, parallel to `owned_tensors`); get
this wrong and the failure mode is not a crash, it's silent all-zero
output, caught only by an actual numeric test
(`xnnpack_executor_test.cpp`'s per-channel `QLinearMatMul` case), not a
build or a null-pointer check.

This makes `GetXnnpackModelExecutor()` an explicitly opt-in *alternative*
executor (pass it to `Simplify` instead of `GetBuiltinModelExecutor()` when
you specifically want XNNPACK — e.g. to test XNNPACK embeddability the same
way `tests/test_tinygrad_integration.py` tests that backend), not a general-purpose replacement: swapping it in for a
model using an unsupported op fails constant folding outright rather than
falling back. `onnxsim/xnnpack_executor_test.cpp` exercises it end to end
(each supported op, a two-node chain, quantize/dequantize round trips,
per-tensor and per-channel `QLinearMatMul`, and the unsupported-op error
path) against independently-computed expected values.

Build it with `-DONNXSIM_BUILTIN_XNNPACK=ON` (see `cmake/build_xnnpack.cmake`,
which `FetchContent`s XNNPACK — pinned by commit, since XNNPACK has no tagged
releases — the same way ORT's from-source build fetches its own `cpuinfo` and
`pthreadpool` dependencies). It composes with `ONNXSIM_BUILTIN_ORT`
independently: a build can have either, both, or neither, and the caller
picks which `GetXxxModelExecutor()` to hand `Simplify`. Not supported for the
Emscripten/WebAssembly build.

The Python adapter still pays a `TensorProto` round trip because the Python side
(onnxruntime's Python API, onnx's reference evaluator) speaks `TensorProto`, not
DLPack. Python is not the zero-copy target; a future dlpack-native Python
executor could bypass it via `__dlpack__`.

### C ABI executor callback (the embeddability seam)

`onnxsim_simplify_with_executor` accepts:

```c
typedef int (*OnnxsimExecuteFn)(
    void* user_data, const void* model_data, size_t model_size,
    const DLManagedTensor* const* inputs, size_t num_inputs,
    DLManagedTensor*** out_outputs, size_t* out_num_outputs);
typedef void (*OnnxsimExecuteFreeFn)(
    void* user_data, DLManagedTensor** outputs, size_t num_outputs);
```

A NULL `execute_fn` falls back to the built-in executor, so the new entry point
is a drop-in superset of `onnxsim_simplify`. The host implements one function in
terms of its own tensors; onnxsim adopts each returned tensor (releasing it via
its DLPack deleter) and then calls `OnnxsimExecuteFreeFn` to release the array
container. The Rust `-sys` crate can add a matching declaration to expose this
(not done in this prototype).

## JsModelExecutor / onnxruntime-web: the separate-heap caveat

`JsModelExecutor` (added in #555, `scripts/convertmodel/js_model_executor.cpp`,
and ported to this boundary here) runs constant folding in onnxruntime-web. This
is the case DLPack helps most — **but with a hard constraint**: onnxsim-wasm and
onnxruntime-web are *separate WASM modules with separate linear memories*. A
`DLManagedTensor.data` pointer minted in onnxsim's heap is meaningless inside
ort-web's heap, so true zero-copy across that boundary is impossible without a
shared `SharedArrayBuffer` memory. Per fold group the realistic path is:

1. onnxsim → JS: `emscripten::typed_memory_view` over onnxsim's heap at the
   tensor's `data` offset → a JS typed-array **view, zero copy on onnxsim's
   side**.
2. JS → ort-web: `new ort.Tensor(dtype, view, dims)` copies into ORT's heap on
   feed — **one copy, unavoidable across modules**.
3. `session.run(...)`.
4. ort-web → JS: read back with `preferredOutputLocation: 'cpu'` — **one copy
   out**.
5. JS → onnxsim: `.set()` into a buffer onnxsim `_malloc`'d and exposed as a
   view — **one copy in**.

So DLPack does **not** remove the memory-domain copies across the ort-web
boundary — nothing can, across two modules. What it removes is the **protobuf
serialize/parse** on every tensor (copy *plus* varint encode/decode). Net
change: `protobuf-encode + 2 domain copies + protobuf-decode` → `2 domain
copies`.

Consequences for the design:

- The **built-in in-wasm `CppModelExecutor` is the zero-copy ideal** (same heap
  → `CreateTensor` borrows directly). `JsModelExecutor` deliberately trades that
  away for what ort-web offers (WebGPU EP, kernels the vendored ORT lacks). The
  same `DLManagedTensor` descriptor serves both; only the deleter differs
  (borrow vs. heap free).
- **WebGPU:** an on-device ort-web output has no portable CPU DLPack pointer.
  First cut: force `preferredOutputLocation: 'cpu'` so outputs cross as
  `kDLCPU`. (`kDLWebGPU` exists in `dlpack.h` but the C++ folder cannot consume
  a GPU buffer.)
- **Batch a whole fold group in one embind crossing** (an array of descriptors),
  not one call per tensor — embind calls have real overhead, and `RunOps`
  already groups nodes per session.

  (`tinygrad.nn.onnx.OnnxRunner`), which imports and eagerly executes an ONNX
  `ModelProto` directly -- no separate compile step, and no vendor hardware
  needed (it runs on tinygrad's own default backend, typically CPU/CLANG on an
  ordinary CI runner). This feeds onnxsim's simplified
  output straight into the target's native ONNX frontend and checks it still
  runs and computes the same result.

## Rust binding

The Rust crates expose the seam:

- `onnxsim-sys`: the DLPack structs (`DLManagedTensor` et al.), `OnnxsimExecuteFn`
  / `OnnxsimExecuteFreeFn`, and `onnxsim_simplify_with_executor`, mirroring the C
  header one-to-one.
- `onnxsim` (safe): `simplify_with_executor(model, options, |submodel, inputs|
  -> Result<Vec<Tensor>, E>)`. Inputs arrive as borrowed `TensorRef`s (dtype +
  shape + little-endian bytes); outputs are owned `Tensor`s. Trampolines convert
  to/from `DLManagedTensor` with an RAII deleter, guard the FFI boundary with
  `catch_unwind`, and validate output byte lengths. The DLManagedTensor
  construction/teardown round trip is unit-tested and verified leak/UAF-free
  under AddressSanitizer.

The `JsModelExecutor`'s `Run` now takes borrowed `DLManagedTensor*` feeds
(reading dtype/shape/bytes directly, names recovered positionally from
`graph().input()`) and returns owning managed tensors built from the runner's
output bytes via `FromTensorProtoOwning`. See `docs/wasm_ort_web.md` for the
onnxruntime-web build variant and its Asyncify sync-C++/async-JS bridge.

`JsModelExecutor` batches a whole fold group's tensors into a single embind
crossing per direction — one concatenated byte blob plus one flat
`[dtype, ndim, dims...]` metadata array — instead of building a JS object per
tensor. The per-fold-group data copies across the two separate heaps remain
(they are unavoidable), but the number of embind round trips is now O(1) rather
than O(tensors × fields). See `docs/wasm_ort_web.md`.

## Follow-ups

- Optional dlpack-native Python executor via `__dlpack__` to drop the Python
  adapter's protobuf round trip.

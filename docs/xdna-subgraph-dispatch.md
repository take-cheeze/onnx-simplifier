# XDNA subgraph dispatch investigation

## Recommendation

Dispatch contiguous graph regions through one IRON runtime invocation, keeping
intermediate tensors and static weights on the NPU for the duration of that
invocation. Choose region boundaries from measured launch, transfer, compute,
and context costs. Do not use operator-count reduction as the objective.

For this ResNet workload, the first useful target is a compiled residual stage
(for example, all blocks in `layer1`) with its entry and exit as the only host
boundaries. Keep the existing per-op path as a fallback for unsupported or
unprofitable regions. The current standalone fused-bottleneck design should
not be selected automatically: its measured kernel-call cost outweighs the
dispatches it removes.

## Evidence from the current RPC runs

All numbers below use `test_model.onnx` at `[1, 3, 32, 32]`, seed 0, and matched
full-graph XDNA/Vitis AI runs on the RPC host.

| Schedule | XDNA latency | Vitis AI latency | Notes |
| --- | ---: | ---: | --- |
| Hybrid, `cpu_small_m=128`, `torch-int8` | 16.10 ms | 1.61 ms | Exact output; 1 XDNA Conv, 1 XDNA MaxPool, 52 CPU Conv calls |
| 14 fused bottlenecks | 137.01 ms | 1.60 ms | Exact output; fused kernel calls sum to 128.89 ms; two blocks fell back at the context limit |

The single native Conv path spends about 1.25 ms in dispatch and post-processing;
MaxPool spends about 0.92 ms in its kernel call. With `cpu_small_m=0`, 51 native
Conv calls spent about 74 ms in kernel calls. This makes one-launch-per-operator
dispatch uneconomical for the small feature maps in this graph.

The Vitis profile has one large `VitisAIExecutionProvider` kernel event at about
1.7 ms, bracketed by small input-quantize and output-dequantize events. Its
`vitis_npu_node_count=3` includes those boundary nodes; it should not be read as
three independently dispatched model partitions.

## Why the current “fusion” misses

The current Conv executor creates an `NPUKernel` call per Conv, uploads the
im2col activation and packed weights, and reads the result back to host memory.
Thus adjacent native Conv nodes do not form a device-resident execution region.
The graph runner's fused bottleneck avoids some host readbacks, but still calls
one separate, synchronous kernel per block. Its runtime sequence transfers the
activation, streams multiple parameter chunks, then drains the output. The
measured 5–18 ms per bottleneck shows that this implementation's dataflow and
launch path need work before increasing fusion coverage.

The existing context planner also has a hard budget of 16 active XRT contexts.
It accounts for unique xclbins, so compiling one artifact per shape/block can
consume the budget before a useful region schedule is formed.

Two runtime-level micro-experiments did not improve the fused block. Batching
all activation/parameter fills into one `TaskGroup` produced the same measured
kernel-call time as finishing each parameter transfer separately (about
11.76 ms for `/layer1/layer1.0`). Compiling its `ExternalFunction`s with
`inline=True` also showed no repeatable improvement (about 11.8 ms). Keep the
serialized transfer path for now; the evidence points to work/dataflow inside
the block runtime, not just task-group or C-call boundaries.

## Dispatch policy to implement

1. **Find legal regions.** Start with contiguous Conv/activation/QDQ sequences,
   residual branches and joins, and pooling. Require compatible quantization,
   layout, and static shapes. Keep unsupported operations at explicit region
   boundaries.
2. **Price each candidate.** Estimate
   `T = launch/context cost + boundary DMA + internal compute + synchronization`.
   Compare a candidate region with the sum of its operator launches and with
   the CPU fallback. Charge every host-visible intermediate and every context
   that the schedule keeps active.
3. **Keep device values resident.** Transfer only region inputs and outputs.
   Reuse immutable weights across inferences when the runtime allows it; stream
   them only when they cannot fit in the chosen on-chip storage plan.
4. **Schedule by latency and resources.** Favor the largest profitable region
   that fits the selected tile/memory budget and the XRT context budget. Use
   spatial parallelism for independent branches only when it reduces critical
   path time after routing, synchronization, and added context costs.
5. **Measure the actual schedule.** Report host-call time, input/weight/output
   transfer time, device compute time, context switches/loads, and boundary
   bytes separately. Compare the same input and graph output against Vitis AI.

The planner should produce a small Pareto set over latency, context count, and
boundary traffic instead of a single “most fused” schedule. For batch-one
latency, reject any fusion whose measured end-to-end launch cost is greater
than the calls and transfers it removes.

## Runtime partition assignment

The ResNet RPC report now includes `runtime_subgraphs`, one row per planned
semantic region. Each row carries the region's entry/exit values, internal
live-buffer estimate, lowering gaps, per-instruction executor assignment, and
contiguous executor segments. It distinguishes a single compiled dispatch,
multiple XDNA dispatches, hybrid host/device regions, and host-only regions.
`native_dispatch_count` counts distinct compiled units inside that planned
region, so a collection of Conv nodes using the same artifact still counts as
separate launches. The report also lists internal device/host crossing values
and edges. In the current quicktest ResNet it reports one connected planned
region, 53 native dispatches, 115 executor segments, and 209 internal
device/host crossings. Vitis AI's ONNX Runtime trace shows one large fused
provider node for the supported part of this same model. The comparison makes
the gap concrete: XDNA has useful kernels, but its graph still crosses the
host/device boundary hundreds of times instead of running as a partition.

The XRT RPC backend now keeps contexts, kernel handles, instruction BOs, and
argument BOs across requests in one serialized server process. It also reports
context-cache hits and misses. The standalone bottleneck artifacts still have
different XRT memory groups at adjacent boundaries, so these boundaries stay
host-staged until they are compiled into a compatible shared region.

## Next experiments

- Split the bottleneck timing into host setup, weight transfer, activation
  transfer, core execution, and output drain. The current `kernel_call_ms`
  combines these costs and cannot identify which part makes the standalone
  fused design slow.
- Prototype one `layer1` region in a **single** runtime/xclbin, linking the
  blocks with device-side FIFOs or buffers. Compare it with per-op Conv and
  per-block bottleneck dispatch using identical inputs.
- Benchmark region candidates at each residual-stage boundary. Track launch
  count, host-visible bytes, unique xclbins, context-budget fallbacks, and
  median latency; do not assume a bottleneck or stage is profitable from node
  count alone.
- Keep `torch-int8` CPU fallback as a measured option for small-M operators;
  do not count those operators as XDNA work in coverage or performance claims.

## Device-side link prototype status

A three-bottleneck IRON prototype is available through RPC as `fused_stage`. It
connects each block's output FIFO to the next block's activation FIFO and keeps
only the first activation, packed parameters, and final output host-visible.
The compiled MLIR contains both links, and the parameter DMA offsets advance
through each packed block in order.

**Root cause found and fixed.** The linked stage was wrong because the per-block
worker functions in `linked_bottleneck_stage_design.py` were closures defined in
the block loop. IRON traces worker bodies after the loop ends, so every block ran
with the *last* block's `chunks1/chunks2/chunks3/skip_chunks`. Identity->identity
links happened to be exact (both blocks have `skip_chunks=0`), but a projection
block followed by anything ran with the wrong weight-stream shape and its
consumers read garbage. The worker factory `_block_workers` now binds the counts.
Bisect that located it: 1 block exact; projection->identity max error 127
(pixel-constant, bias-only-looking output); identity->identity exact.

After the fix, linked `layer1.0`->`.1` and `.0`->`.1`->`.2` are bit-exact against
the CPU reference at every compared boundary. The design now accepts one to three
blocks (`--blocks A [B [C]]`, runner `--fused-stage BLOCK... XCLBIN INSTS`), and
`--tap` (with `ONNXSIM_XDNA_STAGE_TAP=1` in the runner) exists as a debug hook
(note: broadcasting the linked FIFO to a host drain currently times out on the
device, so it is not yet a usable tap).

Measured before kernel work: the linked three-block `layer1` stage took 16.7 ms
per launch, versus 24.9 ms for three separately dispatched fused blocks
(11.1 + 6.9 + 6.9).

### Weight streaming was not the bottleneck; scalar kernels were

Skipping every kernel call (`--nocompute 15`, weights still streamed and awaited
chunk by chunk) left only **~1.0-1.4 ms** for the whole 3-block stage, so the
serialized 167 KB weight stream costs ~1 ms including launch. Skipping all but
one kernel (bitmask `--nocompute`) attributed the remaining ~15 ms as: conv1
~2.5, skip/identity ~3.2, conv2 ~7.3, conv3 ~3.3 ms. Reading the kernels showed
why: the "mmul" paths gathered every 8x8 operand tile with per-byte scalar loops
and branches, ran 64-bit scalar round-half-even per output element, and the
projection skip conv and identity skip were fully scalar. The MMUL unit was a
small fraction of the runtime.

### Vectorized blocked kernels (`--blocked`)

`kernels/fused_bottleneck_blocked.cc` + `blocked_stage.py`:

- Activations are `[C/8][pixel][8]` int8 tiles, so an MMUL A operand is one
  64-byte load. conv1 writes its output into a zero-padded
  `[C/8][H+2][W+2][8]` buffer, so each 3x3 tap of conv2 is also one (unaligned)
  64-byte load of 8 consecutive pixels (needs `W % 8 == 0`, stride 1).
- Weights are pre-tiled on the host into 8x8 MMUL `B[k][n]` tiles; the packed
  chunk order/slot size is unchanged, so the weight FIFO schedule is unchanged.
- The MMUL accumulator is initialized from the bias tile; requantization is one
  vector `srs` with `rounding_mode::conv_even` and **explicit
  `saturation_mode::saturate`** (without it, extreme values wrapped: 28
  mismatching elements), relu is a vector max, and the residual add is two
  `from_vector` shifts plus one add and `srs`.
- The shim DMA converts NHWC <-> blocked at the stage input/output using
  strided BDs, so the host/runner interface is unchanged.
- Debug modes (`--dbg`, `--nocompute`) and an integer numpy model of the block
  were used to bisect skip/q2/q3 stages against ORT.

Result (bit-exact against ORT boundaries at every compared edge):

| Stage | Scalar kernels | Blocked kernels |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| `layer1.0` (projection) alone | ~5 ms | 0.61 ms |
| `layer1.1` (identity) alone | ~5 ms | 0.65 ms |
| `layer1.0`-`.2` linked | 16.7 ms | **1.65 ms** |

### Generalization to every ResNet-50 block shape

The blocked kernels now cover all 16 bottlenecks of the quicktest ResNet (8x8, 4x4,
2x2 and 1x1 maps; stride-2 first blocks; projection skips; weight streams split
into up to 32 output-channel chunks):

- Tiles are 8 flattened output pixels. Maps with `W % 8 == 0` keep the direct
  unaligned-row loads; narrower/smaller maps build their 3x3 windows once per block
  (`chunk == 0`) into a static im2col buffer, and strided projection skips gather the
  sampled input once into a static buffer. Rows past the pixel count are ignored and
  partial tiles are stored through a small scratch copy. Static buffers are reserved
  with `Worker(data_size=...)`: the linker's `data` region is only what is left after
  the FIFO buffers, and the binder budgets them together with the weight slot.
- 3x3 taps that only read padding are pruned from both the kernel loops (compile-time
  tap table) and the packed weight stream (a 1x1 map keeps only the centre tap:
  layer4 conv2 streams 9x fewer bytes).
- Chunking in blocked mode uses output-channel groups that are multiples of 8, a
  larger slot cap (up to 48 KB when tile memory allows) and, with the FIFO/static
  budget, `XDNA_BLOCKED_MAX_CHUNK` overrides it for experiments.
- The runtime sequence issues one whole-stream weight transfer per block plus the
  input fill and output drain without per-chunk waits (FIFO locks throttle each
  stream), so all blocks' streams are in flight together. Streaming-only stages run at
  ~7 GB/s aggregate (layer3 7.5 MB in 1.1 ms; layer4 9.5 MB in 1.3 ms).
- Hot-loop lesson: `MMUL c[G]` accumulator groups must be fully unrolled
  (`#pragma clang loop unroll(full)`); otherwise the accumulators spill to memory and
  every mac becomes a load/store (layer4.0: 3.5 -> 1.0 ms). Also keep constexpr
  helper loops out of runtime paths (a runtime call into a constexpr tap search cost
  ~1.5x on layer3) and use aligned loads for the 64-byte weight tiles.

Stage results, all bit-exact against ORT at the last block's boundary (best of
interleaved runs on a loaded host, single artifact per stage, harness `k()` call):

| Stage (blocks) | Scalar kernels | Blocked kernels |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| layer1 (3) | 16.7 ms | 0.40 ms |
| layer2 (4) | ~30 ms est. | 0.76 ms |
| layer3 (6) | CPU convs | 1.87 ms |
| layer4 (3) | CPU convs | 1.30 ms |

Whole quicktest graph through `run_resnet_xdna.py` with the four stages
(`--fused-stage ... --fused-stage-blocked`): **11.6 ms average**, 0 CPU convs, 16
bottlenecks in 4 launches, output logits identical to ORT CPU (max abs error 0).
Of that, ~8.3 ms is the four stage launches as seen by the runner (host load and
per-launch setup included), ~1.3 ms MaxPool, ~1.9 ms stem Conv dispatch+post and
host QDQ. Vitis AI runs the same graph in ~1.6 ms as one fused provider node.

Note: validate blocks with `--capture`/reference boundary tensors rather than
through the CPU-conv fallback; an early layer3 mismatch that looked like a kernel bug
was traced to that fallback path, not the kernels.

### The remaining cost was context switching, not compute

Running the four stages back to back in one process took 8.3 ms although each stage
alone (same hardware context, repeated) took 3.8 ms in total. Every switch between
xclbins costs ~0.75 ms fixed plus a part that grows with the PDI (w1 +0.8, w2 +1.1,
w3 +1.6, w4 +0.8 ms), even when the two designs use disjoint columns. A multi-device
**full ELF** (`compose_full_elf.py`: four devices, one `@main` sequence with
`aiex.configure`/`aiex.run`, one host launch) is exact but takes the same 8.0-8.3 ms:
a PDI load inside the ELF costs as much as a context switch.

The fix is not to reconfigure at all. ResNet-50's 16 bottlenecks are only 8 *kinds*
(one projection block plus a run of identical identity blocks per stage), and 8 kinds
x 4 cores = the whole 32-core NPU2 array. `resnet_body_design.py` maps each kind to one
column and iterates same-shaped blocks on it:

- requantization shifts are runtime values read from a 64-byte header appended to every
  weight slot (`FUSED_RT_SHIFTS`, `blocked_stage.pack_blocked_params(header=True)`),
  so one compiled block serves blocks with different scales and weights;
- each group's weight streams are concatenated into one transfer; iterations chain
  through a DDR scratch buffer via the shim DMAs (which also do the NHWC <-> blocked
  layout conversion), issued in order by the runtime sequence.

Result: the **whole bottleneck body in one xclbin launch, bit-exact, 3.7 ms** (vs 8.3 ms
chained, 16.7 ms for layer1 alone at the start of this work).

Graph-level (`run_resnet_xdna.py ... --fused-body XCLBIN INSTS GROUPS_JSON
--cpu-small-m 256 --host-maxpool`): the stem Conv (2.4 M MACs; exact float32 BLAS GEMM,
1.2 -> 0.2 ms) and the 16x16 MaxPool run on the host because each extra xclbin would
add a ~0.75 ms+ switch. Measured 7.0-8.4 ms end to end on a host under heavy unrelated
load (body 4.9-5.8 ms in-runner vs 3.7 ms in isolation), logits identical to ORT CPU.
Before this schedule: 13.6 ms (best hybrid) and 76 ms (all per-op XRT).

**Measurement correction.** The first round of tuning results (weight FIFO depth, segment gather,
per-worker streams, memtile staging) was measured by alternating several xclbins in one timing
loop. Each call then pays a ~1.8 ms hardware-context switch, which diluted every difference and
was mistaken for host-load noise. Everything below was re-measured with one artifact per process
(host load average 14-22, so treat +-0.3 ms as noise; repeated runs, minimum reported):

| Variant | Body (all 16 blocks) | Layer4-only body |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| baseline (`resnet_body_design.py` defaults) | 3.6-3.7 ms | 1.90 ms |
| layer4 weight FIFO depth 2 + chunk cap 17 KB (`--weight-depths`, `--chunk-caps`) | 3.3 ms (-9%) | 1.39 ms (-29%) |
| per-worker weight streams (`--split-weights`, `--cols 8`) | n/a (needs > 16 shim channels) | 1.69 ms (-10%; streaming floor 1.21 -> 0.91 ms) |
| memtile weight staging (`--l2-depths 8`) | - | 1.87 ms (no gain) |
| segment gather instead of static im2col (`--seg-gather`) | 6.3 ms (+70%) | - |
| depth 2/3 + smaller caps + segment gather on layer2/3 | 4.9-5.6 ms (worse) | - |

So: double-buffer the layer4 weight FIFOs (small slots after tap pruning make room for two);
keep the static im2col everywhere; memtile staging does not help; per-worker streams help but
cannot be afforded body-wide because the 16 shim MM2S channels are all taken (8 input + 8
weight streams). Chunk caps and depths must match between compile and run; the runner reads
them from `--fused-body`'s group JSON (`{"blocks": [...], "chunk_cap": N, "depth": D}`).
Recommended body build: `--chunk-caps 0,0,0,0,0,0,17000,17000 --weight-depths 1,1,1,1,1,1,2,2`.

The NPU itself is not DDR-limited (reference `memcpy` benchmark: 76 GB/s in+out), and the
weight stream is not limited by tile DMA: see the layer-engine probe below.

Vitis AI inspection (`docs/xdna-vitis-ai-inspection.md`, measured on this host: 1.55 ms min on the
same 32x32 quicktest model): one generic unified xclbin (8 columns, PDI only 19 KB), one HW
context and exactly one EXEC_CMD per inference; an embedded ELF control program sequences 71
layers (55 conv, 16 residual adds, pool) with no block fusion, and **every layer uses all 8
columns** (`enable_col_num=8`, tiling modes OH4OC8/OH8OC4/OH16OC2 split output channels across
columns) so each layer's weights stream on all 8 shim channels. All 25 MB of int8 weights sit in
one host BO and are re-streamed every inference (no residency, no compression); activations
round-trip through DDR between layers. Device time is ~98% of wall, and even Vitis reaches only
~17 GB/s effective (2x its own cost model). This is the architecture that removes our floor:
21 MB over 8 streams is ~0.4 ms versus ~3 ms over the one active stream per block kind.

### Layer-engine feasibility probe (Vitis-style, all 8 columns per layer)

`scripts/xdna/layer_engine_probe.py` spreads one 1x1 conv layer's output channels over all 32
cores (8 columns x 4), one shim weight stream per column (broadcast to its four cores, each
keeps its slice), and repeats it for N layers with fresh weights. Verified bit-exact against
numpy. Measured (isolated runs; NOTE: never time two different xclbins alternately in one
loop -- every call then pays a ~1.8 ms context switch, which produced bogus numbers at first):

- Streaming: 8 layers of 1 MB (K=512, N=2048, P=1) take 0.53 ms with compute (0.48 ms
  streaming-only) including ~0.15-0.2 ms launch, i.e. roughly 25-30 GB/s of weight streaming
  versus ~7-8 GB/s for the one-active-stream-per-block-kind body. This confirms the Vitis AI
  inspection: all-column layers remove the weight-bandwidth floor (21 MB would take ~0.75 ms).
- Per-layer synchronization is the new cost: marginal per layer (tiny layers, nocompute) is
  2.3 / 4.4 / 20 / 36 us for 1 / 2 / 4 / 8 columns, i.e. ~1.2-1.5 us per DMA task issued
  serially by the single control processor (Vitis runs one control stream per column and pays
  ~10-15 us per layer). Issuing each column's weights once for all layers (`--once`) cuts 8
  columns to ~19 us/layer; one broadcast activation stream (`--bcast`) gives ~16 us/layer;
  joining outputs across columns is not possible (an objectfifo cannot sit in two links and a
  memtile has ~6 input channels), so one drain per column remains.

Full-size weight-volume run (`--layers 64 -k 1536 -n 256 -p 8 --once`, verified bit-exact, compute
included): 64 layers x 393 KB = **25.2 MB streamed in 1.015 ms total (16 us/layer, 24.9 GB/s)**,
with or without the broadcast activation stream. That is the ResNet-50 weight volume moved at
Vitis-AI-like layer granularity in *less* than Vitis AI's whole 1.55 ms, so a layer-sequential
engine's floor is ~1.0 ms and the remaining budget (~0.5 ms) is the real per-layer compute
(3x3 im2col gather, residual adds, stem/pool). Design constraints found while sizing it: a core
program unrolled over 53 different layers overflows program memory by 4.6 KB (a per-layer
acquire/release sequence is ~300 B), so jobs must be uniform (loop over identical jobs, layer
shape from the descriptor) or grouped per stage with `range_`; and FIFO objects are fixed-size,
so a layer's per-core weight slice must be split into passes of at most one slot (K-split with an
accumulator kept across jobs for the widest 3x3 layers).

Projection for a full layer-sequential ResNet-50 engine: 55 conv layers x ~16 us sync (~0.9 ms)
+ streaming (~0.75 ms, partly overlapped) + compute + launch, roughly 2-2.5 ms. It was built (next
section) and came out better than projected.

### Layer-sequential engine (`layer_engine_design.py`, `kernels/layer_engine.cc`)

Vitis-style: every conv layer of layer1..layer4 is one *job* spread over all 32 cores (8 columns x 4
rows); layers run one after the other, activations round-trip through a small DDR arena.

- **Work split.** A layer's output channel blocks (8 channels) are dealt to cores in order; core `s` owns
  `nbc = ceil(NB/32)` consecutive blocks, so narrow layers simply leave cores idle. Each core writes its
  blocks to a fixed 512-byte *region* of the layer's arena slot (32 regions = 16 KB), so the next layer's
  input is "NCP regions of NBP blocks of P pixels" and the packed weights follow that reduction order.
- **Kernel.** One runtime-shaped function (`layer_chunk`) serves every layer: a 192-byte descriptor at the
  start of each per-core weight chunk carries the geometry, taps, K-chunk range, shifts, residual mode
  and the (tap, region) decomposition of the chunk start (no divide on the core). Weights that do not
  fit one 4 KB slot are K-split over several chunks with the int32 partial sums kept in core memory.
  Paths: direct GEMM (1x1), a zero-padded-copy path for stride-1 3x3 (the copy is built once, in each input
  region's unused bytes or the activation object's tail; a tile is then 1/2/4 contiguous row segments), and
  a masked 8-row gather for strided 1x1/3x3.
- **Data movement.** One broadcast activation stream (a residual map is queued as a second object one job
  early), one weight stream per column carrying its four cores' chunks (each core keeps its own; all
  weights issued once), one output drain per column. Program memory (16 KB) rules out a per-layer
  unrolled core program (~450 B per job), so the core runs 4 stages x (projection block + `nid[s]`
  identity blocks) as `range_` loops whose chunk counts come from a small table in core memory: 7 job
  bodies for 52 jobs.
- **Arena.** 4 reused slots (64 KB): `assign_slots` reuses a slot once its last reader (a residual is read a
  job early) has run.

Results (32x32 quicktest model; weights come from the model's block bindings via
`layer_engine_net.jobs_from_bindings`, the artifact only needs the job structure):

| configuration | pooled map -> layer4 | notes |
|---|---|---|
| stage-column body (previous best) | ~2.4 ms | one active column per stage |
| engine, broadcast weights (`--net bodyr --looped`) | 1.60 ms | 0.97 ms with every kernel call skipped |
| engine, memtile-staged weights (`--l2 2`) | **1.03 ms** | 0.82 ms with every kernel call skipped |
| engine + stem/pool jobs (`--net full --looped --l2 2`) | **1.11 ms image -> layer4** | pooled map and all 16 blocks bit-exact vs ORT |

Through the graph runner (`--layer-engine XCLBIN INSTS STAGES_JSON --layer-engine-stem`, RPC
`resnet_engine` / `layer_engine`) the full graph takes **1.65 ms** (1.7-2.0 ms in noisier windows), logits
identical to ORT (max abs error 0.0; `--dump-output` saves them), versus 3.55-3.84 ms for the best
stage-column network and 1.55 ms for Vitis AI. Device call ~1.2 ms; the host part is image quantize +
im2col (~0.1 ms) and the classifier tail (~0.15 ms) plus Python.

What made the difference, and what did not:
- **Memtile staging with per-core distribution (`--l2`) was the biggest single win (1.59 -> 1.03 ms).**
  With broadcast, every core received all four cores' slices and looped over four acquires per chunk
  round; now the shim streams whole 4-slice objects into the column's memtile and the memtile hands each
  core only its own slice (`ObjectFifoLink` with destination offsets). Streaming is ~40 GB/s, the
  per-round core loop is 4x shorter, and compute overlaps with streaming (kernel time went from +0.63 ms
  to +0.2 ms over the floor). L2 depth 4 needs too many memtile BDs (24 per channel); depth 2 is best.
- The first 3x3 version gathered every 8-pixel tile per (tap, input block) with 64-bit copies: ~290
  cycles per tile, 1.03 ms for the 3x3 layers. The padded-copy segment path cut stride-1 3x3 layers from
  ~60 us to a few us each. Masks were not the cost (removing them changed nothing); the per-tile scalar
  loop control was.
- Loops over (tap, region) steps pay ~60-100 cycles of scalar control per step on this core; making the inner
  loop a uniform-stride pointer walk (`run` blocks of one tap) lets the compiler emit a zero-overhead loop.
- With broadcast weights, more FIFO depth (3, 4) did not help (depth 3 was 15% slower: acquire index
  rotation); slots above 4 KB do not fit the data banks once the L2 distribution FIFOs are added.
- Memory is bank-structured: two 16 KB activation objects take two of the four 16 KB data banks, the rest
  (weights, out, partial sums, stack) shares the remainder; the padded 3x3 copy therefore lives inside the
  activation objects' unused bytes.
- Host: the runner's `_max_pool` looped per output pixel in Python (0.5 ms); one strided slice per kernel
  tap is 0.08 ms. With the stem and pool on the device nothing but quantize + im2col remains before the
  device call.
- Stem and pool as jobs: the 7x7 stem is four 1x1 GEMM jobs (host im2col chunks of 64 pixels, K padded to
  152) draining into one dense 64 KB stem map with a strided output pattern (block `s`, chunk `c` at
  `s*2048 + c*512`), then a pool job (mode 2 in the kernel) over that map; slots 0-8 are reserved for
  these, the body reuses 4.

### Other models: layer engine vs Vitis AI, and how close to ideal

Both runtimes were run on the same models on the same host (Ryzen AI 1.8 Vitis AI EP, `real_npu`, 32x32
input, batch 1, min of 3 x 300 timed iterations; ours through the graph runner, min of 3 x 100, stem/pool/
all convs on the device, classifier tail on the host). The quicktest model is one Quark-quantized net, so
the other depths come from `quantize_pow2_resnet.py` (torchvision, random weights with non-trivial BN
statistics, same QDQ pattern: uint8 zero point 128 activations, int8 power-of-two weights/biases,
quantized head), which both runtimes accept; `compare_models.py` runs the whole comparison. Every row is
bit-exact against ONNX Runtime CPU (max abs logit error 0.0):

| model | weights MB | MMACs | Vitis AI ms | ours ms (device call) | ours / Vitis | streaming floor ms | MAC floor us |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| ResNet-18 (basic blocks) | 11.7 | 37.5 | 0.83 | 0.89 (0.58) | 1.08 | 0.27 | 2 |
| ResNet-34 | 21.8 | 75.3 | 1.42 | 1.17 (0.85) | 0.82 | 0.51 | 3 |
| ResNet-50 | 25.5 | 85.5 | 1.63 | 1.70 (1.18) | 1.04 | 0.59 | 3 |
| ResNet-101 | 44.4 | 161.2 | 2.90 | 2.64 (1.89) | 0.91 | 1.03 | 6 |
| ResNet-152 | 60.0 | 237.0 | 4.08 | 3.12 (2.48) | 0.76 | 1.40 | 9 |
| Wide-ResNet-50-2 | 68.8 | 234.6 | 26.3 | 2.89 (2.30) | 0.11 | 1.60 | 9 |

- The engine supports bottleneck nets of any depth/width (`--arch 3,4,23,3`, `--arch 3,4,6,3:2`) and basic-block
  nets (`--arch basic:2,2,2,2`, ResNet-18/34; `layer_engine_basic.py`); one artifact per architecture, weights
  are packed at run time. Not supported: grouped/depthwise convs (ResNeXt, MobileNet, EfficientNet) and input
  sizes whose activations no longer fit a 16 KB object (about 32x32 today), so those models only have Vitis
  numbers. Vitis AI's Wide-ResNet time (26 ms) is ~9x its ResNet-50-scaled expectation; the reason (probably
  layers left on the CPU) was not investigated. It handles 224x224 models, which the engine does not.
- The engine wins from ResNet-34 up because per-job overhead is fixed while weight bytes grow; it is
  slightly behind on the two smallest nets, where the ~0.3 ms of host work (image quantize, im2col, tail,
  Python) is a larger share.
- **Ideal**: at 32x32 these nets are weight-bandwidth bound, not compute bound: even at the NPU's 25 TMAC/s
  (50 TOPS int8) the MACs take 2-9 us. The "streaming floor" is weights / 43 GB/s (the best rate the engine
  reached with every kernel call skipped: 28.8 MB in 0.65 ms). The engine's device time is 1.4-2.2x that
  floor: for ResNet-50, 0.82 ms is the floor of the current job structure (launch ~0.17 ms + 57 jobs, kernels
  skipped) and the kernels add 0.31 ms (28%) that does not overlap with streaming. DDR itself (256-bit
  LPDDR5X) would allow far more, so the remaining gap to a true roofline is per-job synchronization
  (~10 us: one activation fill + eight column drains through one control processor, ~1.3 us per DMA task)
  and the 8 shim weight streams.
- What the remaining ideas can buy (bounded by the skipped-kernel run): conv1+skip fusion saves 4 of 57
  jobs (~40 us), a faster stride-2 gather touches 6 jobs (~50 us of the 310 us kernel time), and a second
  weight channel per column cannot help while the floor is per-job bound and the activation stream already
  takes the 16th shim MM2S channel (17 would be needed). None is worth its complexity next to the host
  overhead (~0.5 ms on ResNet-50) or a design that keeps activations in L2 between layers.
#### Non-ResNet vision models (same generator, 32x32, Vitis AI only)

`quantize_pow2_resnet.py` also handles ReLU6 (`Clip`), `Concat`, `AveragePool` and linear residual Adds, so
a few other torchvision families were built and timed on the Vitis AI EP (random weights):

| model | Vitis AI ms | vs CPU logits | what the engine / codegen would still need |
|---|---|---|---|
| GoogLeNet | 1.12 | exact | branch outputs concatenated along channels (jobs writing block ranges of one slot), 5x5/3x3 branches, stride-1 max pool; the generic per-conv codegen plans it (82 dispatches) |
| RegNet-X 400MF | 1.74 | exact | grouped 3x3 (group width 16: a 2-block reduction per output block instead of all input blocks), a 3x3 stride-2 stem, and 16x16 maps (the kernel assumes <= 64 pixels per layer); the generic codegen plans it (118 dispatches) |
| MobileNetV2 | 3.08 | argmax differs (max abs 0.105) | depthwise 3x3 (vector MACs, not MMUL), ReLU6 clamp in the epilogue, add-only jobs, and 16x16..96-channel maps (24 KB > the 16 KB activation object); the generic codegen rejects `Clip` |

The engine stops at ResNet-style nets for three structural reasons rather than one missing kernel: activation
maps are limited to 16 KB / 64 pixels per layer (larger maps need pixel tiling, which changes the region
layout), there is no grouped/depthwise reduction (per-output-block input ranges), and no channel-range
placement for Concat. Each is a design change to the arena layout, so they were not attempted here; Vitis AI
handles all of these models and shows that the same NPU sustains ~1-3 ms on them at 32x32. Models that did not
export through the generator (SqueezeNet: shared bias initializers; EfficientNet/MobileNetV3: SiLU/HardSwish;
DenseNet: standalone BatchNorm; ShuffleNet: Split/Transpose; AlexNet/VGG at 32x32: too small / huge FC) have no
numbers.

#### Operator expansion through tinygrad lowering (`tinygrad_lower.py`, `layer_engine_graph.py`)

The engine used to stop at ResNet-shaped graphs. Three additions widen it, and tinygrad supplies the semantics
for everything the engine has no kernel of its own for:

- **Table jobs (`kind="lut"`)**: activations are 8-bit, so any pointwise unary op (HardSwish, Sigmoid, Tanh, GELU,
  Erf, Softplus, Mish, LeakyRelu, ...) is one 256-entry byte table. The table is built by executing the op's
  single-node ONNX model through tinygrad's ONNX frontend (`OnnxRunner`, pure-Python device, no host compiler)
  on the 256 dequantized inputs and requantizing; `is_pointwise_unary` finds such ops *by execution* (permuting
  the input must permute the output), so no per-op list is needed (Softmax is correctly rejected). The core
  runs the table over its own blocks; cost is negligible.
- **Depthwise 3x3 (`kind="dw"`, kernel mode 4)**: every output block reads only its own input block, so it is
  one elementwise multiply-accumulate per tap with the channel weights replicated over the tile's eight pixel
  rows (masked gather of the shifted tile, stride 1 or 2), plus the usual bias/requant epilogue.
- **ReLU6 as an int8 clamp** (`clamp` field in the epilogue), and a **graph compiler** for straight-line QDQ
  graphs: Conv 1x1/3x3/depthwise + Relu/Clip + QuantizeLinear, an Add of a conv result and an earlier tensor
  fused into the conv's residual epilogue (MobileNet's linear bottleneck), and unary ops as table jobs. The core
  program for such nets is one table-driven loop over jobs (`--net onnx:MODEL.onnx`).

Result: a MobileNetV3-style mini network (8x8 maps; six pointwise+ReLU6/HardSwish layers, three depthwise
layers including stride 2, two fused residual adds; 20 jobs) is **bit-exact against ONNX Runtime** on the
NPU (0 of 1024 output bytes differ) in 0.45 ms for the engine part (Vitis AI runs the whole model, tail
included, in 1.50 ms and differs from CPU logits by up to 0.14). The 256-entry-table approach relies on the
activation being 8-bit; 16-bit activations would need interpolation. Still missing for real MobileNet/EfficientNet
inputs: maps larger than 64 pixels / 16 KB (pixel tiling), Concat, grouped convs other than depthwise,
Squeeze-and-Excite (a GAP -> FC -> Sigmoid -> broadcast Mul: needs a reduce job and a broadcast multiply job).

#### YOLO and more operators (`layer_engine_graph.py`, `quantize_pow2_graph.py`)

The graph compiler was generalized from a chain to a DAG and grew the data-movement operators a YOLO
backbone/neck/head needs. New job kinds (all runtime-shaped, one kernel):

| job | operator | notes |
|---|---|---|
| `copy` | Split, Concat (channel axis) | per-output-block source (object A or B), block and scale exponent in the payload; a Concat of n tensors is n-1 pairwise jobs with each source re-scaled to the output's power-of-two scale |
| `up` | Resize nearest x N | pixel replication, optional re-scale |
| `maxpool` | MaxPool k x k "same" | any odd k / stride (SPPF's k=5, the stem's k=3 stride 2 replaces the old pool mode) |
| `add` | Add of two activations | the residual epilogue arithmetic on two objects (YOLO's bottleneck Add sits after the SiLU, so it cannot fuse into the conv) |
| `gap` | GlobalAveragePool | power-of-two pixel counts, round-half-even shift |
| `bmul` | Mul by a 1x1 gate | squeeze-and-excite: activation x per-channel gate |
| `dw` | depthwise 3x3 and 5x5 | all K*K tap vectors packed |

- **SiLU** is `Sigmoid -> Mul` in ONNX: `quantize_pow2_graph.py` leaves the pair unquantized between one Q/DQ
  pair, and the compiler collects *any pointwise chain* between a DequantizeLinear and a QuantizeLinear into one
  table job built by running the chain through tinygrad (`tinygrad_lower.subgraph_table`).
- **Large early maps run on the host.** A job whose output map does not fit a core's 512-byte region (the first
  high-resolution layers, YOLOv5's 6x6 stride-2 stem) is marked host: the compiler emits it separately, the
  harness runs it with the same numpy reference the tests use (float64 BLAS, exact for these integer sums) and
  writes the result into the arena with a wide-region layout (`D_REG`) that the first engine job reads.
- **Host tail**: everything after the last engine operator (Reshape, Softmax, the box decode) consumes the
  *boundary* tensors the engine leaves in the arena (`Compiled.boundaries`).
- A residual/second operand is prefetched a job early unless the previous job produces it (then it is queued
  right before the job's input); the generic core program takes two act objects per job and loops over a table
  of chunk counts.

Results (32x32 input, Ultralytics YAML models with random weights and unit-variance init, quantized to power-of-two
QDQ; all engine outputs **bit-exact against ONNX Runtime** on the detection-head Conv outputs, and the decoded
detections from the host tail equal ORT's exactly):

| model | engine jobs (host jobs) | engine call | prefix + engine + read-back | host tail (ORT) | Vitis AI |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| YOLOv8n | 170 (2) | 1.71 ms | 2.02 ms | 0.05 ms | 3.29 ms |
| YOLOv5nu | 169 (2) | 1.69 ms | 2.44 ms | 0.05 ms | 4.42 ms |
| YOLOv8n at 64x64 | 155 (17) | 1.83 ms | 2.96 ms | 0.06 ms | 3.75 ms |
| MobileNetV3-style with 5x5 depthwise + SE (8x8) | 35 (0) | 0.54 ms | 0.55 ms | - | (mini model: 1.5 ms class) |

Vitis AI's outputs differ from CPU on these models (decoded coordinates by up to 10 px at 32x32 and 148 at 64x64,
argmax flips), so it is faster only when it is also less accurate; our numbers are for exactly ORT's arithmetic.
Engine time per job is ~10 us, so a 170-job network is bound by per-job synchronization, not by compute.

Other Ultralytics families at 32x32, compile coverage (engine jobs before the first unsupported operator):

| model | engine jobs | verdict |
|---|---|---|
| YOLOv8n-seg | 187 (10 boundaries incl. the mask prototype head) | runs on the device, bit-exact, 2.1 ms |
| YOLOv10n | 206 (2) | two launches like YOLO11n; bit-exact boundaries, decoded output within 1e-7 of ORT, 5.8 ms |
| YOLO11n | 223 (2) | runs on the device in **two launches** (host C2PSA attention between them), bit-exact boundaries, decoded output within 1e-7 of ORT, 7.0 ms total (4.6 ms engine) |
| YOLOv6n | 27+ | `ConvTranspose` as conv + depth-to-space jobs; exact, 1.19 ms (Vitis AI 1.955 ms) |
| YOLOv9t | 4+ | ADown slices folded by onnxsim before codegen; exact, 4.6 ms (Vitis AI 11.06 ms) |
| YOLOv3-tiny | 0 | MaxPool k=2 (even kernel) is not a "same"-padded odd pool |

Float regions in the middle of a network (YOLO11's C2PSA attention: Reshape/Transpose/MatMul/Softmax) run on the
host between engine launches (`layer_engine_host.py`): each level is one full launch of the same xclbin and arena
(earlier levels just recompute identical values, so no xclbin switch), the host evaluates the float nodes with onnx's
reference evaluator and quantizes the re-entering tensors into pinned arena slots. The depthwise kernel has no fused
residual, so an Add after a depthwise conv stays a separate `add` job.

Not supported yet: real detector resolutions (640x640): maps of hundreds of pixels need pixel-split layouts and larger output
objects, which is the "activation-tiled" engine this weight-streaming design deliberately is not. At 64x64 the
host already computes 17 of 172 jobs.

- Host findings worth keeping: OpenBLAS defaulted to one thread per core, and a 2048x1000 Gemm took 2.9 ms on
  this 64-thread host versus 0.05-0.1 ms with 1-2 threads (the runner now sets `OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS=2`
  before numpy loads); a 1000-class head made the runner 3x slower before that fix.
#### More vision models through the graph compiler (32x32 inputs, bit-exact vs ORT on every engine boundary)

`run_graph_engine.py MODEL.onnx` (quantize with `quantize_pow2_graph.py` / `quantize_pow2_resnet.py`); device
call + host prefix/tail, median of 10-50 runs on a busy host (+-0.2 ms):

| model | engine jobs (host jobs) | ours | Vitis AI |
|---|---|---|---|
| ResNet-18 / 34 / 50 through `compile_graph` | 21 / 37 / 54 (1) | 1.5 / 1.7 / 2.2-2.8 ms | 0.83 / 1.42 / 1.63 ms |
| MobileNetV2 | 48 (5) | 1.65 ms | 3.08 ms |
| RegNetX-400MF (group-16 convs) | 70 (2) | 1.6-2.0 ms | 1.74 ms |
| GoogLeNet | 97 (1) | 2.4 ms | 1.12 ms |
| SqueezeNet 1.1 | 37 (1) | 1.03 ms | - |
| MnasNet 1.0 (5x5 depthwise) | 73 (4) | 2.3 ms | - |
| MobileNetV3-Small (SE, hard-swish) | 104 (2) | 2.2 ms | - |

What these needed: grouped (non-depthwise) convs run as dense convs with a block-diagonal weight; a depthwise
job whose per-core weights overflow the 4 KB slot is split into channel-block slice / dw / concat parts; maps
larger than an arena slot keep their producers *and* consumers on the host until they shrink (MobileNetV2's first
layers); max pools take any kernel/padding/`ceil_mode` (GoogLeNet, SqueezeNet); residual blocks `Add -> ReLU` fuse
into the conv and a downsample skip fuses the Add itself; 3x3 convs on maps whose width is not 1/2/4/multiple of 8
(SqueezeNet's 7x7) use the gather path (the padded-copy path assumed whole 8-pixel row segments).

Still not supported: EfficientNet / ConvNeXt (mid-network maps over 64 pixels per channel block; see the coverage
section below) and any 224x224 input. GoogLeNet is where Vitis AI is ahead (9 inception blocks of 1x1/3x3/5x5
branches: 99 sequential jobs at ~10 us each versus Vitis's fused subgraphs). ShuffleNet and DenseNet, listed as
unsupported in the first version of this section, are covered now (next section).

#### Operator coverage: layer engine vs Vitis AI

How this was measured: Vitis AI EP 1.8 (XDNA2) was run with ORT profiling on each model and the nodes that ran on
`CPUExecutionProvider` counted (`graph ops` below are the original ONNX nodes; Vitis rewrites the graph before
partitioning, so its counts are fallbacks after its own passes). For the engine, "float host ops" are the nodes
`compile_graph` leaves as float host nodes, without the Quantize/Dequantize/Constant bookkeeping. Models are 32x32
QDQ graphs from `quantize_pow2_graph.py`; ours are all bit-exact against ORT on every boundary.

| model | Vitis AI: ops falling back to CPU | engine before this work: float host ops (launches) | engine now: float host ops (launches) | Vitis AI ms | engine ms |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| ResNet-18 / 34 / 50 | 0 | Flatten + Gemm (1) | **0** (1) | 0.83 / 1.42 / 1.63 | 1.3 / 1.7 / 2.1 |
| MobileNetV2 | 20 (FusedConv, GAP, Flatten) | 2 (1) | 2 (1) | 3.08 | 2.1 |
| MobileNetV3-Small | 42 (HardSigmoid, Mul, Gemm, GAP) | 4 (1) | **0** (1) | 4.64 | 2.0 |
| MnasNet | 2 (ReduceMean, Gemm) | 2 (1) | **0** (1) | 1.21 | 2.6 |
| ShuffleNetV2 | 50 (Reshape x32, Transpose x16) | 145 (**14**) | **0** (1) | 3.79 | **1.5** |
| DenseNet-121 | 167 (BatchNorm x62, Relu x62, QLinearConcat) and the compile crashes | 127 (**66**) | **0** (1) | - | **4.4** |
| EfficientNet-B0 | 239 (Conv x81, SiLU Sigmoid/Mul x98, GAP, ...) | compile fails | compile fails | 4.67 | - |
| ConvNeXt-T | 254 (LayerNorm, Gelu, Gemm x37, Reshape/Transpose) | compile fails | compile fails | 14.7 | - |
| YOLOv8n | 19 (Concat, Reshape, Add, Sub, Sigmoid, Softmax, ...) | 24 (1) | 24 (1) | 3.29 | 2.4 |
| YOLO11n / YOLOv10n | Vitis compile crashes | 34 (2) | 34 (2) | - | 5.3 / 5.1 |
| transformer encoder, 2 layers | 0 (float graph, bf16) | 20 (3) | **0** (1) | 4.25 | **0.76** |

Operator by operator (Vitis column = observed on these models, not a spec):

| operator | layer engine | Vitis AI |
|---|---|---|
| Conv 1x1 / 3x3 / strided, any channel count (rows padded to 8) | yes | yes |
| depthwise 1x1 (BatchNorm) / 3x3 / 5x5 / 7x7 | yes | yes (3x3/5x5; MobileNetV2's FusedConv falls back) |
| grouped Conv | as a block-diagonal dense conv (extra MACs) | yes |
| ConvTranspose | kernel == stride (conv + depth-to-space) | partly |
| standalone BatchNorm (+ Relu) | as a depthwise 1x1 conv | falls back (DenseNet) |
| Add, Add+Relu, Mul (gate / same shape) | yes (Add fused into the conv) | yes (SiLU/HardSigmoid Mul falls back) |
| Relu, Clip(0,6), Sigmoid, SiLU, HardSwish, HardSigmoid, GELU, Exp, Reciprocal, Sqrt, Erf, Tanh | one 256-entry table job each (any pointwise chain) | Relu/Clip yes; the rest fall back |
| MaxPool any k/pad/ceil_mode, AveragePool, GlobalAveragePool / ReduceMean(H,W) | yes (power-of-two windows for averages) | yes |
| Concat, Split, Slice | yes, including channel counts that are not multiples of 8 (channel-gather job) | yes (QLinearConcat falls back in DenseNet) |
| channel shuffle (Reshape/Transpose/Reshape) | channel-gather job | falls back (48 ops in ShuffleNet) |
| Resize (nearest, integer factor) | yes | yes |
| Flatten + Gemm | Flatten = copy job, Gemm = 1x1 conv | falls back (Gemm on CPU in 4 of the models) |
| MatMul activation x activation (attention) | `amm` job (multiple-of-8 tokens) | bf16 path |
| Softmax, LayerNormalization | decomposed into conv / product / table jobs | falls back in the QDQ path (ConvNeXt), bf16 path for float graphs |
| Reshape / Transpose in general | host (only the shuffle and attention-head patterns are recognised) | partly |
| activation maps over 16 KB / 64 px per channel block | **no** (host chain, or compile error) | yes (tiles through the memtile) |
| scales that are not powers of two | via `onnx_to_engine.py` requantization (not bit-exact to the source) | yes (per-channel scales) |
| per-channel weight scales | no (one shift per job) | yes |

What closed the gaps, all in `layer_engine_graph.py` / `quantize_pow2_graph.py` unless noted: Gemm/Flatten/
ReduceMean tails run on the engine, so classification nets end with no host operator; standalone BatchNorm is a
depthwise 1x1 conv (the quantizer emits it, `dw` accepts K=1); `cgather` (kernel mode 14, `Job.chan_spec`) gathers
arbitrary channels, which covers Slice/Split/Concat at channel counts like 58 and the channel shuffle (the
compiler tracks the real channel count of every tensor from ONNX shape inference and pads conv rows to 8); a Q over
a DQ of an engine tensor (what onnxsim leaves of a single-input Concat) becomes a re-scale copy or nothing; a
DenseNet-style Concat that grows by one tensor reuses the previous concat (723 -> 246 jobs); the kernel data
memory now sizes its partial-sum buffer to the widest multi-chunk job.

`onnx_to_engine.py MODEL.onnx OUT.onnx [--report]` makes any model engine-ready: float models are calibrated and
quantized, QDQ models with arbitrary scales have their activation Q/DQ pairs removed (a zero-point-0 uint8 Q that a
QDQ quantizer used to fold a Relu/Clip into gets its Relu back), weights dequantized and the graph requantized with
power-of-two scales, and already-compatible QDQ is copied. It is not bit-exact to the source QDQ model: on
ImageNet-pretrained torchvision models at 32x32 (ORT static QDQ as the source, fp32 as the reference) the output
cosine to fp32 is ResNet-18 0.995 (ORT QDQ) vs 0.980 (ours), SqueezeNet 0.999 vs 0.988, MobileNetV2 0.78 vs 0.64:
per-tensor power-of-two weights cost accuracy on depthwise-heavy nets.

Remaining gaps versus Vitis AI, and why: (1) **large activation maps**: every core holds its whole input map in a 16 KB
object and writes <= 512 B, so a 224x224 network, EfficientNet's and ConvNeXt's mid-network maps do not fit;
pixel-banding them would need hundreds of jobs per layer (this engine is a small-map design by construction, and
the 16 KB/512 B limits are the same ones that cap transformers at 32-64 tokens); (2) **per-channel weight scales and
non-power-of-two multipliers** (one `to_vector<int8>(shift)` per job); (3) the YOLO decode tail (Concat/Reshape/
Sub/Add/Softmax over float) stays on the host, about 0.1-0.4 ms.

#### Transformers: layer engine vs Vitis AI vs Hexagon HTP

`tiny_transformer.py` builds a pre-LN encoder as a power-of-two QDQ graph in "tokens are pixels" form
(`[1, hidden, 1, tokens]`), every operator of which is an engine job, so a whole encoder is **one launch**:

| transformer op | engine jobs |
|---|---|
| Linear (Q/K/V/O, FFN) | 1x1 conv; LayerNorm's gamma/beta and the 1/sqrt(d) are folded into the next conv |
| residual Add | fused into the o-proj / FFN2 conv epilogue (the residual stream is a uint8 tensor) |
| LayerNorm | `x - mean` = one dense conv with `I - 1/C`; `d*d` = elementwise product job (`bmul`, same-shape mode); variance = conv of `1/C`; rsqrt = table job; `d * rsqrt` = product job |
| GELU, exp, reciprocal | table jobs (tinygrad-lowered pointwise chains) |
| attention scores `K^T Q` and context `V P` | new `amm` job (kernel mode 15): per-head int8 tile matmul of two activation maps; B is transposed in-kernel for the scores |
| softmax | exp table, per-head key sum (block-diagonal ones conv), reciprocal table, product job |

The previous version of this section kept LayerNorm, attention and the residual stream in float on the host
(3 launches per layer); `--ln host --attn host` still builds that form. A network input that is float (no leading
Q) and a network output that is an engine tensor are both supported now. The C = power of two requirement keeps
the `1/C` conv weights exact in int8; other widths run but the mean/variance are then approximate.

Same model (32 tokens, hidden 128, 4 heads, FFN 512), ms per inference, all bit-exact on the engine against ORT on
the quantized graph:

| layers | engine launches | our engine (host LN/attention, before) | **our engine (all ops on device)** | Vitis AI EP (bf16) | Hexagon HTP V69 (fp16) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 1 | 1.8 (4 launches) | **0.58** | 2.35 | 0.23 |
| 2 | 1 | 3.7 (7) | **0.76** | 4.25 | 0.31 |
| 4 | 1 | 9.0 (13) | **1.56** | 7.75 | 0.45 |
| 6 | 1 | 15.9 (19) | **2.08** | 11.3 | 0.61 |

Accuracy of the int8 power-of-two graph (activations uint8, per-tensor weights, no calibration tuning, 8-bit
softmax/LayerNorm statistics) against the fp32 graph with the same weights: token cosine 0.998 / 0.994 / 0.989 /
0.980 for 1 / 2 / 4 / 6 layers; Vitis AI's bf16 is 0.999 and Hexagon fp16 0.999998.

The real MiniLM-L6 (`scripts/android/llm_tinygrad`, seq 128, hidden 384; ~1.4 GMAC) still cannot run on the engine:
a channel block's tokens must fit one 512 B core region (<= 64 tokens at the narrowest width, 32 at the 4x FFN
width). Same weights, encoder body only (embeddings and the mask bias fed in), measured:

| | ms / inference | accuracy vs fp32 |
|---|---|---|
| Hexagon HTP fp16 (full graph incl. embeddings + pooling, phone) | **1.92** | cos 0.999998 |
| Vitis AI EP on XDNA2 (bf16 kernels, 197-node body) | 5.30 | token cos 0.9991 (min 0.9986) |
| this host's CPU, ORT fp32 | 12.9 | exact |
| phone CPU, ORT fp32 4 threads (busy phone; README's quiet-phone number was 24.7) | 86 | exact |

Reading it: with every op on the device, the engine is 4-5x faster than Vitis AI on the small encoder and within
2.5-3.5x of Hexagon, whose per-model cost is a fixed few tenths of a millisecond (fp16 vector/HMX matmuls, one fused
graph). Remaining engine cost is ~10 us per job (143 jobs for 6 layers) plus one launch, so it scales with depth;
fewer, wider jobs (fusing the LayerNorm chain into the next conv, a per-head softmax kernel) are the next levers.
The size limit (tokens per channel block) and int8 accuracy (vs fp16/bf16) are what keep it from MiniLM-scale models.

### Runtime-shaped kernels (`kernels/fused_bottleneck_rt.cc`, `resnet_body_design.py --rt`)

The compile-time kernels bake a block's geometry in through `-D` macros, so every block kind
needs its own code and a core cannot serve two shapes (program memory is 16 KB/core). The
runtime-shaped kernels read the geometry from a 192-byte descriptor at the start of every weight
slot (`blocked_stage.rt_descriptor` / `pack_rt_params`: W/H/C/MID/OUT/OW/OH/stride, chunk counts,
tap list, bias offsets, shifts, and per-chunk output-block counts precomputed on the host); only
buffer *capacities* (`RT_COL_BYTES`, `RT_SKIPX_BYTES`) stay compile-time. One kernel set serves
all 16 ResNet-50 blocks: the whole body built on it is bit-exact and takes 4.16 ms vs 3.6 ms
compile-time (1.16x; 7.0 ms before the fixes below). Per stage vs compile-time: layer1 0.65 / 0.59,
layer2 0.90 / 0.65, layer3 2.17 / 1.80 ms.

What made the difference (each was found by keep-one-kernel profiling and, once, reading the
generated assembly):
- **No division in any loop.** The AIE has no integer divider, so `x / runtime` is a software
  routine (~100+ cycles). Compile-time shapes hid this (divisions became shifts). Runtime
  versions computed `kk / MB`, `o / OW`, `t*8 / W` in the GEMM, epilogues and gathers; replacing
  them with nested tap x block loops, per-pixel row/column tables filled by counters, and
  host-precomputed block counts took layer1 from 2.4x to 1.1x.
- **Base pointer + stride inner loop.** The GEMM takes `a_base(t, tt)` and `a_stride`, so the
  inner loop is one load, one pointer add and G MACs. Index math inside the loop produced a ~60
  line non-pipelined body with stack spills.
- **`noinline` epilogues.** Inlining four epilogues into every GEMM instantiation overflowed
  program memory by 450 B-1.6 KB; the epilogues run once per output tile, so `noinline` is free.
  Two instantiations only (G=4 and G=2 with a guarded dead tail for odd block counts).
- **Gather rows with 64-bit accesses.** The im2col/strided-skip builds compute the eight source
  pixel offsets once per (tap, tile) and copy each row with one aligned `uint64` access for every
  input block (byte-wise `memcpy` of unknown alignment was ~4x slower).
- The identity-skip kernel takes its byte count as an argument, and a conv1 core links only the
  skip kernel it actually uses (identity groups never link the projection skip).
- Descriptor + weights must match: use `--rt` at compile time and `pack_rt_params` (runner:
  `--fused-body-rt`; RPC: `options["rt"]` on compile, `fused_body["rt"]` on run).

### Whole network on the device: stage columns + on-device stem/pool

With runtime-shaped kernels a core column is not tied to a block shape, so `resnet_stage_design.py`
runs each ResNet stage (projection block + identity blocks) in ONE column: FIFO objects are sized to
the stage maximum, DDR transfers are always whole (padded) objects, activations between blocks stay in
the linear 8-channel-blocked layout, and every weight slot is padded to the stage's common slot
(`pack_rt_params(binding, slot_bytes=...)`). The four stages use 4 columns and 8 shim channels, and the
body is bit-exact at 4.0 ms (8-column version: 4.16 ms; compile-time kernels: 3.6 ms). This frees 4
columns and half the shim MM2S channels.

`--stem` adds a fifth column that runs the stem Conv and MaxPool before the stages (`stem_pool.py`
host side, `BLK_STEM`/`BLK_POOL` in `fused_bottleneck_rt.cc`): the host quantizes the float image
(scale 2^-7, zero point 128) and builds a blocked im2col (K = 3*7*7 = 147 padded to 152, four chunks of
64 pixels); core 0 runs the stem as a 1x1 GEMM per chunk with the requantization shift of 9 and ReLU
(uint8 zero point 128 output, so the MaxPool is a plain byte max: padding 0 never wins because ReLU
outputs are >= 128, and the pool's Q has the same scale as its input); core 1 assembles the 16x16 map
and pools it to 8x8, and the result is drained to DDR as the first stage's input. It uses three extra
shim streams (image, weights, pooled map) and no extra xclbin.

Result (`run_resnet_xdna.py --device-network XCLBIN INSTS STAGES_JSON`): the pooled map equals ONNX
Runtime's bit for bit, the image -> layer4 pipeline takes 4.18 ms on the device (only 0.18 ms more than
the body), and the full graph runs in **5.15-5.3 ms** with logits identical to ORT CPU, versus ~7-8 ms with
the stem/pool on the host. Two host-side fixes were needed to see that gain: constant-only
`DequantizeLinear` nodes (weights, biases) are now evaluated once at start-up and skipped in the run loop
(70 -> 14 host node visits per inference, ~0.5 ms), and the im2col is vectorized (0.35 -> 0.2 ms).
What remains on the host: image quantize + im2col (~0.2 ms), GlobalAveragePool/Q/DQ/two Gemms (~0.4 ms)
and Python overhead; the device call is ~4.3 ms.

Per-worker weight streams in the stage-column design (`resnet_stage_design.py --split-weights 0,0,1,1
--cols 8`): now affordable because the stage columns freed shim channels (4 activation + 3 stem + the
weight streams; `--cols 8` is needed so all shim tiles are reachable). Each core of a split stage gets its
own weight FIFO/shim stream: its slice of the projection block once, then its slice of every identity block
at the block stride, and nothing is discarded. Exact everywhere. Measured one artifact per process:
layer4 stage alone 2.22-2.28 -> 1.98-2.04 ms (-10%); image -> layer4 with layer3 and layer4 split
4.17-4.24 -> 3.55 ms (-15%; layer4 only: ~4.0 ms). Through the graph runner the split artifact was faster
than the baseline in every same-window comparison (5.4-5.9 vs 6.4-7.9 ms device call on a host at load
12-19, so absolute times there are inflated).

Tuning the stage-column network further (host at load ~6; one artifact per process): double-buffering
layer4's per-core weight FIFOs (`--weight-depths 1,1,1,2`; depth 3 is no better) takes image -> layer4
from 3.56 to 3.15 ms (-11%); layer3 cannot double-buffer (its 33 KB slots sit next to the 18 KB im2col
buffer), and splitting layers 1-2 as well is impossible: the placer reports all 8 shim tiles at 16/16 MM2S
channels once layers 3 and 4 are split (4 activation + 2 stem + 2 + 8 weight streams). Best configuration:
`resnet_stage_design.py --stem --cols 8 --split-weights 0,0,1,1 --weight-depths 1,1,1,2`. Through the
graph runner (`--device-network`) that measures **3.55-3.84 ms end to end** (device call 3.2 ms, host prep
0.12-0.18 ms) versus 4.6-5.1 ms for the unsplit baseline in the same windows, logits identical to ORT CPU;
Vitis AI is 1.55 ms, so the remaining gap is ~2.3x.

What bounds the body now: streaming-only runs of layers 3/4 take 1.1/1.3 ms
(~7 GB/s per weight stream) and the whole body's 21 MB of weights need ~3 ms at that
rate, against 3.7 ms total, so it is weight-bandwidth bound. Only one block kind is
active at a time and each kind has a single shim MM2S stream (the 16 shim MM2S
channels are all taken by 8 input + 8 weight streams), so a faster body needs either
more concurrent weight streams for the active group (e.g. memtile staging that
prefetches ahead of compute, or sharing input channels) or fewer weight bytes.

The Vitis capture adds selected quantized tensors as ONNX graph outputs and
runs them through a separate Vitis AI session. RPC XDNA capture saves linked
stage or standalone fused-block outputs to NPZ files when `capture_outputs` is
enabled. These captures establish that the mismatch appears only with the
linked stage, but the current stage artifact exposes only its final boundary.
The next diagnostic is to tap intermediate linked-stage FIFOs or build a
temporary host-drained stage variant so the first failing boundary can be
identified. Keep the RPC `fused_stage` path experimental until those boundary
comparisons are exact.

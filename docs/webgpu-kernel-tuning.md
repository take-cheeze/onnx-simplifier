# Tuning a tinygrad-generated WebGPU kernel via real browser execution

**Status: experimental.** `onnxsim.webgpu_kernel_tuning.generate_kernel_candidates`
generates several *alternative* WebGPU kernels for the exact same
computation -- differently tiled/upcast/unrolled variants of the same
kernel `onnxsim.webgpu_tinygrad_codegen` would otherwise render exactly
once -- so a caller can dispatch every candidate on a **real** WebGPU
device and keep whichever is actually fastest there, via
`webgpu_kernel_dispatcher.mjs`'s own `profile: true` GPU timing (see
`docs/webgpu-kernel-dispatch.md`'s own "Profiling" section).

## Why this needed its own module, not just `BEAM=N`

tinygrad already has an autotuner. Setting `BEAM=N` makes
`tinygrad.codegen.to_program` call `tinygrad.codegen.opt.search.beam_search`,
which tries several `Opt`-tuned kernel variants and picks the fastest --
**by actually compiling and running each one itself**, via `dev =
Device[s.ren.target.device]` (`tinygrad/codegen/opt/search.py`, read
directly off the installed 0.14.0 source). That line is exactly the wall
this whole `webgpu_tinygrad_codegen` module family exists to route around:
it needs a real, natively-loaded `Device["WEBGPU"]` (the actual
`dawn`/`wgpu-native` shared library), which frequently isn't available
wherever kernels are *generated* (a CI runner, a server, this repo's own
dev sandboxes) even though it's exactly what an end user's real browser
always has.

`onnxsim.webgpu_kernel_tuning` reuses only the **device-free half** of
tinygrad's own autotuner -- `tinygrad.codegen.opt.postrange.Scheduler` and
`tinygrad.codegen.opt.search.get_kernel_actions`, which enumerate candidate
`Opt` combinations via plain Python schedule manipulation
(`Scheduler.copy()` + `.apply_opt()`, no compilation, no device at all).
What tinygrad's own `beam_search` does *next* -- compile, run, time, pick
-- is the caller's job instead, against a real WebGPU device reached from
JS.

## What it does

`generate_kernel_candidates(named_tensors, output_name, max_candidates=32)`
has the same contract as
`onnxsim.webgpu_tinygrad_codegen._lower_tensor_program` (the same
leaf-tensor/output-name inputs), but for each real kernel tinygrad
schedules, returns a `KernelCandidates` (one `WebgpuKernelStep` per
candidate `get_kernel_actions` finds, capped at `max_candidates`) instead
of only tinygrad's own default rendering. A kernel's tuning options change
its loop/tiling structure -- how many work-items iterate, how much stays in
registers/local memory -- never *which* buffers it reads or writes, so
every candidate shares identical bindings; only `wgsl`/`entry_point`/
`dispatch` differ. `KernelCandidates.spec_for(index, intermediates)` builds
the single-step `WebgpuKernelSpec` `dispatchWebgpuProgram` actually
consumes for whichever candidate a caller wants to run.

## Verified end to end, with a real speed difference

`scripts/convertmodel/test/webgpu_kernel_tuning.test.mjs` dispatches every
candidate from `make_webgpu_kernel_tuning_fixture.py`'s fixture (8
candidates for a real `Conv2D`) on a real WebGPU device (Playwright/
Chromium), with `profile: true`, and checks:

- Every single candidate -- not just whichever turns out fastest --
  computes the numerically correct output against
  `onnx.reference.ReferenceEvaluator`. Tuning options that changed
  correctness would be a tinygrad bug, not something this module tries to
  re-verify in general, but checking it here costs nothing and catches a
  wiring mistake on this module's own side.
- Real per-candidate GPU durations come back, and picking the minimum
  actually mattered: verified by hand against this exact fixture, the
  *untuned* baseline (`applied_opts == []`) was the **slowest** of the 8
  candidates -- about **3x slower** than the fastest tuned one
  (`~2.9ms` vs `~0.94ms`). Real, not hypothetical: tinygrad's own default
  (non-BEAM) rendering is not a good kernel for this shape on this device.

## Scope

Like `webgpu_tinygrad_codegen` itself, this only ever produces candidates
-- generation, dispatch, timing, and picking a winner are three separate
steps, and only the first happens in Python. A model with more than one
scheduled kernel call gets candidates enumerated independently per call;
this module does not attempt to jointly tune across calls, and there is no
persistence/caching layer yet for a picked winner (e.g. keyed by GPU
vendor/browser) -- a caller re-runs the whole dispatch-and-compare loop
every time today. There is no cap on how many candidates get generated --
every one `get_kernel_actions` finds is dispatched and timed.

## How much could tinygrad's tuned kernel outperform WebNN?

`scripts/convertmodel/test/webgpu_kernel_tuning_vs_webnn.test.mjs` answers
this directly, on the *same* Conv2D as the fixture above: it dispatches every
tinygrad-tuned candidate (fastest wins) and, separately, runs
`webgpu_kernel_tuning_fixture.onnx` (the same Conv2D, saved as an ordinary
standalone model by `make_webgpu_kernel_tuning_fixture.py`) through
onnxruntime-web's WebNN execution provider -- both timed the same way
(wall-clock median over several warmed-up runs), since WebNN has no
GPU-timestamp-query equivalent exposed through onnxruntime-web the way
`dispatchWebgpuProgram`'s own `profile: true` does.

Like `webnn_reshape_placement.test.mjs` (`docs/webnn.md`,
`onnxsim/webnn_target.py`), this is **attempted and reported, not required**:
WebNN's browser support is still experimental. Concretely, in this repo's own
dev sandbox (headless Linux Chromium), `navigator.ml` is absent under plain
`--enable-unsafe-webgpu`, but *does* appear -- and its `"gpu"` device type
context actually builds and runs -- once
`--enable-features=WebMachineLearningNeuralNetwork` is also passed. So
whether the comparison runs at all depends on that flag and the runner's
browser, not the platform alone; when no WebNN device is reachable, the test
still reports tinygrad's own fastest candidate (useful on its own) and skips
only the comparison-specific checks.

**A measured result** from that sandbox: WebNN's `"gpu"` device type came out
**~1.7-2.4x *faster*** than tinygrad's own best-tuned candidate across
repeated runs -- the opposite direction from what the tuning work above might
suggest. Take that with real caution, though: neither side is running on real
hardware there. WebGPU goes through SwiftShader's software rasterizer (see
`webgpu_hf_demo.test.mjs`'s own comment), and Chromium's WebNN `"gpu"` device
type falls back to its own software ML backend when there's no real GPU/NPU
init path available in a headless Linux container. So this result says
neither backend is a safe default assumption in a software-emulated sandbox
-- it does not say which one wins on an end user's actual GPU or NPU. Treat
the *magnitude* (WebNN and a hand-tuned custom kernel can land within a small
constant factor of each other on the same op) as the finding, and the
*direction* as unconfirmed pending a run on real hardware (a real macOS/
Windows CI runner, or a developer's own machine with
`ORT_REQUIRE_WEBNN=1 npm run test:webgpu-kernel-tuning-vs-webnn`).

This is also why offloading conv/matmul/gemm to WebNN wholesale (the other
half of the question that motivated this work) isn't a clear win to chase
blindly: where WebNN is actually reachable, it's already competitive with a
hand-tuned custom kernel on at least this op, without onnxsim needing to
generate or maintain any kernel at all -- but `onnxsim.webnn_target`'s own
gaps (non-constant `Reshape`/`Expand` shapes, INT64 graph boundaries) mean
"reachable" is model-dependent, and this comparison only covers the one op
it measures, not the fusion patterns (conv+activation) the original question
also asked about.

## Running the tuner from the actual converter page

Everything above ran offline (a Python script) or through a Node+Playwright
test -- useful for proving the idea, but not something a visitor to the
actual converter page (`scripts/convertmodel/index.html`) could ever trigger
themselves. `scripts/convertmodel/webgpu_kernel_tuner.mjs` closes that gap: an
opt-in **"Tune this kernel…"** button on every node in the loaded model, in
the existing "Custom WebGPU kernels" panel
(`webgpu_kernel_annotations_view.mjs`), runs the *entire* loop above live, in
the browser, no server involved. This includes nodes that don't already
carry any kernel metadata -- which is nearly every real upload, since
`onnxsim.webgpu_tinygrad_codegen`'s own server-side gap-flagging only ever
attaches one for the narrow Conv3D/align_corners-Resize cases
`onnxsim.webgpu_target` detects. (An earlier version of this button lived
only inside an already-attached node's own entry, so it never showed up at
all on an ordinary model -- fixed by having `onnx_conv_node_reader.mjs`'s
`listAllNodeNames` list every node in the graph, and offering the same tune
UI on any of them not already shown above; see
`webgpu_kernel_annotations_view.mjs`'s own `setSide` for the fix and
`test/webgpu_kernel_tuner_ui.test.mjs`'s "plain Conv node" scenario for the
regression check.)

### Any op type, not just Conv

The button isn't Conv-only: `tuneNodeKernel` drives **tinygrad's own generic
ONNX importer** (`tinygrad.nn.onnx.OnnxRunner`) instead of a hand-written
per-op-type translation, so it can tune a node of *any* op type that
importer supports -- Gather, Transpose, Concat, Pad, Slice, elementwise, and
so on, not only Conv. Two problems this has to solve that Conv-only tuning
didn't:

- **Isolating one node's own kernel.** Same trick as the original Conv-only
  implementation: rebuild *only* the target node's computation from fresh
  random leaf tensors (never the real, chained whole-graph tensors), so
  tinygrad's scheduler can't fuse it with a neighbor. This is what lets a
  caller swap in exactly one node's own kernel without touching the rest of
  the exported graph. A node whose isolated computation needs *zero* kernel
  calls (a pure view op -- a contiguous `Reshape`/`Transpose`/`Squeeze` that
  needs no data movement on its own) is a normal outcome, not an error --
  the panel shows "needs no dedicated WebGPU kernel in isolation" instead of
  a candidate table. A node that schedules to *more* than one kernel call in
  isolation still isn't supported (same restriction Conv-only tuning always
  had) and raises a clear error.
- **Resolving "python-const" inputs without a real device.** Some ops take a
  *structural* argument as a second tensor input rather than an attribute
  (`Reshape`'s target shape, `Slice`'s starts/ends/axes, ...) --
  `tinygrad.nn.onnx.required_input_python_consts` marks which. Resolving one
  needs `Tensor.tolist()`, which needs to *realize* that tensor -- but
  realizing **any** WEBGPU-tagged tensor for any reason tries to load
  tinygrad's native wgpu-backed device library, which doesn't exist inside
  Pyodide (or most native builds without it installed). So this runs the
  *whole* graph once, for real, on tinygrad's "PYTHON" device -- a
  pure-Python UOp interpreter needing no native library at all, the one
  tinygrad device that actually works inside Pyodide -- purely to learn
  every python-const value and real shape/dtype the target node needs, then
  rebuilds that node's isolated computation on a *separate*, never-realized
  WEBGPU-tagged instance using those resolved values. See
  `webgpu_kernel_tuner.mjs`'s own module docstring for the full two-pass
  design.

Verified end to end in `test/webgpu_kernel_tuner_ui.test.mjs`'s own Gather
scenario (`make_webgpu_node_tuning_fixture.py`) -- a real "memory operation"
(unlike a pure view op, Gather still needs its own dedicated kernel even in
isolation) with a non-python-const, non-float index input, proving the
generalization beyond Conv/float pipelines specifically, not just a renamed
copy of the same Conv path.

1. **Generation, live, via Pyodide.** `webgpu_kernel_tuner.mjs` boots
   [Pyodide](https://pyodide.org/) (loaded from a CDN on first use, not
   bundled into the page) and fetches tinygrad's wheel straight from PyPI --
   the same numpy-free, onnx-free-Python-package technique
   `pyodide_webgpu_onnxrunner_codegen.test.mjs` already proved works for a
   whole graph, extended here to `onnxsim.webgpu_kernel_tuning`'s own
   `Scheduler`/`get_kernel_actions` approach so *several* candidates come
   back for one isolated node, not just tinygrad's own default rendering.
   Both downloads are real, multi-second, multi-megabyte fetches -- nothing
   loads until the button is clicked, and a second tuning run (same node or
   a different one) reuses the already-booted runtime.
2. **Dispatch, live, on a real device.** Every candidate is dispatched via
   the page's own `webgpu_kernel_dispatcher.mjs` against zero-filled buffers
   sized to the node's real shapes (see `webgpu_kernel_tuner.mjs`'s own
   docstring for why concrete values don't matter here -- picking a winner
   is about speed, and kernel generation never depends on them), timed the
   same way `webgpu_kernel_tuning_vs_webnn.test.mjs` times its own
   candidates, ranked, fastest first.
3. **Export.** Clicking **"Export tuned model"** attaches the winning
   candidate's `WebgpuKernelSpec` onto that exact node via
   `onnx_metadata_writer.mjs`'s `attachWebgpuKernelSpec` -- the write-side
   counterpart to `onnx_node_metadata.mjs`'s read-only
   `readWebgpuKernelSpecs`, and the JS equivalent of
   `onnxsim.webgpu_kernel_metadata.attach_webgpu_kernel` -- and downloads the
   result. This is a from-scratch, hand-rolled protobuf field editor (see
   that module's own docstring): it never assumes it understands the whole
   `ModelProto` schema, only the one path from the top-level message down to
   the target node's `metadata_props`, so every other field at every level
   (initializers, other nodes, opset imports, ...) round-trips untouched,
   verified byte-for-byte in `test/onnx_metadata_writer.test.mjs`. Nothing
   about Simplify/Optimize themselves changes -- a tuned export is a separate
   download, on top of whatever model bytes are already in the page.

## Tuning the whole graph in one click

Clicking each node's own "Tune this kernel…" button one at a time works fine
for a handful of nodes, but doesn't scale to a real model with a dozen or
more. A **"Tune full graph…"** button (once per side, shown whenever the
model has at least one tunable node) runs the exact same per-node loop above
for every node in sequence:

- Pyodide and tinygrad's wheel load once and stay cached across nodes
  (`webgpu_kernel_tuner.mjs`'s own module-level singleton), but each node's
  own candidate-dispatch loop still costs real GPU time, so tuning a model
  with many nodes can take a while -- the button reports live per-node
  progress (`N/M done`) rather than looking hung, and each node's own card
  in the panel updates as the batch reaches it (the batch drives the exact
  same per-node state a single click would, nothing is duplicated).
- A node that fails to tune (non-static shape, unsupported op, more than
  one scheduled kernel call, ...) is recorded as failed on its own card and
  the batch moves on to the next node -- one bad node doesn't block tuning
  the rest of the graph. A node that schedules to zero kernel calls in
  isolation (a pure view op) is recorded as done with nothing to export,
  not a failure.
- **"Export full graph"** chains `attachWebgpuKernelSpec` across every node
  that tuned to a real kernel into a single download -- the writer's own
  bytes-in/bytes-out shape makes this a plain loop, no new low-level
  machinery needed.

**Verified end to end** in `test/webgpu_kernel_tuner_ui.test.mjs`'s own
`runFullGraphScenario`, against a purpose-built fixture with *two*
independent Conv nodes (`webgpu_kernel_tuning_multi_conv_fixture.onnx`): one
click tunes both, one export carries both winners, and dispatching each
exported kernel against a real device reproduces both nodes' own ground
truth -- proving the batching itself (more than one node actually gets
tuned, and the export chaining actually carries more than one winner), not
just the same single-node path run twice.

**Verified end to end** in `test/webgpu_kernel_tuner_ui.test.mjs`, driving the
*real* page (not a synthetic harness), for two scenarios: a fixture with an
already-attached kernel, and a plain Conv model with none at all (the
regression case above). Each: load the fixture, click Tune, wait for several
real candidates with real per-candidate timings, click Export, and confirm
the downloaded model's attached kernel both matches the chosen winner and
still computes the right answer against the same ground truth
`webgpu_tinygrad_codegen.test.mjs` itself checks against. The one piece that
sandbox couldn't verify against the real, public CDN is noted in that test's
own comment (an internal network-policy restriction specific to this repo's
dev sandbox, not a property of a real visitor's browser or of the CI runner
this test runs on) -- everything else, including the tinygrad-wheel-from-PyPI
fetch, the real dispatch loop, and the export/re-verify round trip, was
proven working, unmodified, end to end.

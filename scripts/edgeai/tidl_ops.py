"""Static op-support heuristic for TI's TIDL (edgeai) accelerator offload.

`TexasInstruments/edgeai <https://github.com/TexasInstruments/edgeai>`_ is the
umbrella repo for TI's edge AI SDK -- model training/export/quantization
tooling (``edgeai-modeloptimization``, ``edgeai-tensorlab``,
``edgeai-tidl-tools``, ...) that targets **TIDL** (TI Deep Learning), the
inference engine for the C7x-MMA deep-learning accelerator on TI's
Jacinto/Sitara SoCs (TDA4x, AM62A/68A, ...).

Like Axera's Pulsar2 (see ``scripts/axera/pulsar2_ops.py``), TIDL has no PyPI
package and no ONNX Runtime execution provider installable via a plain
``pip install`` -- the TIDL-enabled ``onnxruntime`` build (``onnxruntime_tidl``,
TI's own fork) ships as part of TI's PSDK/edgeai-tidl-tools SDK, downloaded
from ``software-dl.ti.com``/``downloads.ti.com``. **This module itself still
wraps no real compiler and makes no hardware- or compiler-confirmed claims
on its own** -- everything here is a static heuristic. It is, however,
checked directly against edgeai-tidl-tools' own published
``docs/operators.md`` ("Supported Operators") and ``docs/
vision_transformers.md`` ("Vision Transformers"), fetched from
``raw.githubusercontent.com`` rather than reconstructed from memory --
catching, among other things, a backwards GELU rule an earlier version of
this module's sibling ``legalize.py`` had (see that module's docstring for
the correction and exactly what changed).

A sibling module, ``real_compile.py``, *does* wrap a real compiler now:
once this repository's network policy allowed reaching
``software-dl.ti.com``/``downloads.ti.com``, an actual compile/import via
TI's real ``onnxruntime_tidl``/``tidl_tools`` binaries (x86 "PC
emulation"/compile-only mode) became possible -- see that module's
docstring and ``tests/test_edgeai_tidl_real_compile.py``. This module's
heuristic still runs on every PR regardless (no download, no network
dependency), with the real check as a stronger, skip-guarded second
opinion when the toolchain is reachable.

Two things TIDL's public documentation states plainly enough to check for
without hardware:

1. **No dynamic shapes.** TIDL compiles a fixed-shape subgraph ahead of time;
   every graph input must have a fully static shape (including batch size).
   A symbolic/unknown dimension anywhere is a hard blocker, not a "runs on
   CPU fallback" case.
2. **Some ops just don't map onto the accelerator.** Control flow
   (``If``/``Loop``/``Scan``), the ``Sequence``/``Optional``/``Map`` types,
   and string tensors have no fixed-function NPU/DSP equivalent on *any*
   accelerator of this class -- this is the same generic complement
   ``pulsar2_ops.py`` and the sibling QNN/OpenVINO/MIGraphX backends use, not
   a TIDL-specific list. ``NonMaxSuppression`` is included too: TIDL's
   detection post-processing runs NMS on the host ARM core, not as an
   in-graph accelerator op, per edgeai-tidl-tools' own detection-model
   documentation.

Presence of one of these is a strong signal the graph (or region of it) will
not run on TIDL's accelerator as-is; *absence* is not proof the rest offloads
cleanly -- this harness only checks op *type* and shape-staticness, not the
per-op attribute-level constraints (e.g. supported ``Resize`` modes,
``Conv`` group/dilation limits) TIDL's docs also list.

A third thing worth checking for, specifically for transformer-style graphs:
``docs/operators.md`` lists ``LayerNormalization`` as its own directly
supported layer (``TIDL_LayerNormLayer``), so the decomposed
``ReduceMean``/``Sub``/``Pow``/``Sqrt``/``Div`` chain -- a handful of
separate elementwise/reduction ops the importer has to recognize and fuse
itself, rather than one op it already knows -- is worth flagging.
``has_decomposed_normalization()`` below does that.

**GELU is the opposite case, confirmed by actually reading the doc rather
than assuming symmetry with LayerNorm**: ``docs/operators.md`` has *no*
``Gelu`` entry at all -- only ``Erf``/``Identity``, explicitly "not
supported as an individual operator... only supported as part of the fused
combination of GELU". ``docs/vision_transformers.md``'s own GELU section
confirms why: the importer pattern-matches the decomposed
``Div``/``Erf``/``Add``/``Mul``/``Mul`` sequence itself and maps it to
TIDL's internal BatchNorm-with-activation layer, so a literal ONNX ``Gelu``
node (opset 20+) has nothing to match. This module does not add a
"decomposed GELU" flag -- unlike LayerNorm, the decomposed form here is
already what's wanted, so there is nothing to flag; ``legalize.py``'s
``unfuse_gelu_to_erf`` handles the one direction that does need acting on
(a literal ``Gelu`` node).

Two model families this harness's suite adds fixtures for:
**MobileNetV2** (the inverted-residual bottleneck backing
edgeai-tidl-tools' own real object-detection and segmentation example
configs) and a **Vision Transformer** encoder block, built using the fused
``LayerNormalization`` op and the *decomposed* GELU form -- see
``scripts/edgeai/models.py``'s docstring for exactly where each is verified.

**Quantization: QDQ only, never QOperator.** ``docs/operators.md`` lists
``QuantizeLinear``/``DequantizeLinear`` themselves as supported (only in
"ONNX QDQ models"), but has no entry anywhere for the fused-integer
QOperator-format ops (``QLinearConv``, ``QLinearMatMul``, ``ConvInteger``,
...) a different quantization tool might emit instead of the QDQ
(float-sandwiched-by-Q/DQ) form. ``QOPERATOR_OPS`` below flags those --
real ONNX ops, just not ones this importer's supported-op list has a
mapping for. See ``scripts/edgeai/quantize_for_tidl.py`` for the
recommended way to actually produce a QDQ-format model (via
``onnxsim.calibration.quantize_static``/``quantize_static_int16``,
verified structurally against ``docs/quantization.md``'s per-layer
scheme table) and, importantly, for a real, reproduced compiler crash
that recommendation stops short of papering over: feeding that QDQ output
back into the real ``TIDLCompilationProvider`` via
``advanced_options:prequantized_model=1`` segfaults the x86 PC compiler in
the exact `tidl_tools` release this was tested against (11_02_20_00) --
confirmed on both a `Conv`-only and a `MatMul`-only model, so it is not
specific to one op or to onnxsim's own output shape. That module's
docstring has the full record.

# BEVFormer-tiny on the Hexagon HTP

The real BEVFormer-tiny (official `bevformer_tiny_epoch_24.pth`), rebuilt in plain PyTorch
(no mmcv / mmdet / mmdet3d / mmdeploy), validated against upstream semantics on real nuScenes-mini
frames, then exported and run piece by piece on the phone's HTP through QNN.

## Files

Reproduce (each heavy step under `systemd-run --user --wait --collect --pipe -p MemoryMax=16G -p MemorySwapMax=0`):

```sh

## Validation (CPU fp32, scene-0103 frames 0-2, peak 1.3 GB)

* `msda_rank5` vs mmcv's reference: max abs diff 0.
* checkpoint: all 643 tensors mapped; unused = `code_weights` (loss weights) + `cls_branches.0-4`
  (aux classifiers of the 5 intermediate decoder layers; inference decodes only the last layer).
* rank-5 encoder/decoder vs the upstream-literal path: max abs diff 0 on every frame (the SCA
  all-queries + visibility-mask formulation is exact).
* detections (score >= 0.3, same class within 2 m of a GT center): frame 0 8/23 GT, frame 1 11/29,
  frame 2 16/30 -- temporal context (prev_bev) helps as expected. The 9 CAN-bus signals are 0
  (CAN-bus expansion not in v1.0-mini), so this is a sanity check, not an mAP number.

## Export (each piece its own systemd-run, MemoryMax=16G)

| piece | inputs | ONNX nodes (sim) | ORT CPU vs torch | peak RSS |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| backbone1 | img 1x3x480x800 | 121 | 1.4e-5 max abs | 1.5 GB |
| backbone6 | img 6x3x480x800 | 121 | 2.2e-5 | 2.6 GB |
| enc1 | feats 6x256x15x25, prev_bev, has_prev, shift, can_bus, ref_cam 6x2500x4x2, bev_mask | 107 | 7.7e-6 | 1.8 GB |
| enc3 | same | 245 | 1.1e-5 | 2.0 GB |
| decoder | bev_embed 2500x256 | 482 | 2.1e-4 | 1.3 GB |

Nothing came close to the 16 GB cap; no external data was needed (largest file: backbone, 98 MB).

## Phone: Snapdragon HTP (V69) via ORT 1.26 + QNN EP 2.6.0 / QNN 2.50, fp32 graph run as fp16

Frame 1 of scene-0103 (has_prev = 1), median of 10, burst perf mode:

| piece | QNN refused ops | strict all-HTP | median ms | cos vs fp32 torch |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| backbone1 | 0 | PASS | 20.4 | 1.00000 |
| backbone6 | 0 | PASS | 129-184 (shared phone, varies) | 1.00000 |
| enc1 | 0 | PASS | 105 | 0.99999 |
| enc3 | 0 | PASS | 241 | 0.99999 |
| decoder (+head) | 0 | PASS | 25 | 1.00000 (cls and bbox) |

Every piece of the real model runs entirely on the HTP (rank-5 MSDA; nothing refused).

### End to end on real frames (`e2e_phone.py`, scene-0103 frames 0-5)

The three pieces chained on the phone, each fed the previous piece's HTP output, with the HTP's
own BEV carried to the next frame as prev_bev (rotated/shifted on the host):

| | fp32 torch (CPU) | HTP fp16 |
|---|---|---|
| per-frame cos vs fp32 (feats / bev / cls / bbox) | - | 1.00000 / 0.99999 / >=0.99999 / 0.99999, no drift over 6 frames |
| GT matched (same class, <2 m, score >= 0.3), 6 frames | 106 / 190 (273 dets) | 105 / 190 (274 dets) |
| latency per frame | - | backbone6 126 + enc3 241 + decoder 25 = ~392 ms (2.5 FPS) |

fp16 on the HTP is accuracy-neutral for BEVFormer-tiny. The encoder (60% of the time, 6
GridSamples on 2500 queries) is the next target; int8 PTQ of the backbone the other.

### fp16 precision bisect (the "cos 0.986" of the plan's synthetic probe; 0.916 on the real model)

Two independent causes, both fixed in `model.py` with exact (fp32-identical) rewrites:

1. **ref_cam overflow.** Upstream divides projected points by `max(depth, 1e-5)`, so pillar
   points behind a camera land at |xy| up to 6.7e6, beyond fp16's 65504. Clamping to [-1, 2] (originally [-5, 6]) on
   the host is exact (validate.py: clamped vs unclamped max abs diff 0) because such points still
   sample zero padding.
2. **QNN miscompiles stack -> reshape -> Gemm.** TSA projects its 2-frame value queue as
   `value_proj(stack([prev, cur]))` = reshape (5000, 256) -> Gemm. On the HTP that Gemm output
   is scrambled (cos 0.12 vs ORT CPU), but only when the intermediates are *not* graph outputs:
   exposing all of them (the first bisect attempt) hides the bug (cos 0.99999). Found by
   exposing a few tensors at a time (`bisect_run.sh`): the Concat is correct, the Gemm right
   after the reshape is not. Projecting each frame separately and stacking afterwards fixes it
   (enc1 cos 0.916 -> 0.99999) and is 36% faster (165 -> 105 ms).

## int8 on the HTP (`quantize.py`, `onnxsim.full_qdq`)

`onnxsim.quantize_static` only wraps MatMul/Gemm/Conv *inputs* in Q/DQ, which leaves every Conv
output (and each Relu/Add/MaxPool) as float, so the HTP runs it in fp16. `onnxsim.full_qdq`
(new) quantizes the whole graph into QDQ node units: calibrated uint8 activations
(`onnxsim.calibration.calibrate`), int8 per-channel weights, int32 biases, data-movement ops
sharing their input's qparams, Relu folded into the producer's Q (zp 0), plus `quantized_io` for
uint8 (and NHWC) graph I/O. That covers the Mask R-CNN backbone's hand rewrites
(`../../htp_exploration/ceiling/`: int8 residual Adds, uint8 I/O, NHWC image input) by
construction.

Calibration: fp32 torch over the first 3 keyframes of scene-0061, -0553, -0757 and -1077 (night),
chained with prev_bev: 12 samples, all disjoint from the scene-0103 evaluation frames.

```sh
C=~/.cache/onnxsim-bevformer; S="systemd-run --user --wait --collect --pipe -p MemoryMax=16G -p MemorySwapMax=0"
$S python3 quantize.py calib --ckpt $C/bevformer_tiny_epoch_24.pth --data $C/nuscenes-mini --work $C/work
$S python3 quantize.py backbone --work $C/work          # -> backbone6.q8.onnx (+ .json io qparams)
adb push $C/work/backbone6.q8.onnx /data/local/tmp/bevformer_tiny/
$S python3 e2e_phone.py --ckpt ... --data ... --work $C/work --backbone backbone6.q8
```

The backbone is calibrated on `backbone1` (one camera per batch, 72 batches; peak 4.2 GB) and
the ranges are applied to `backbone6` (identical tensor names). Result, strict all-HTP, burst:

| backbone (6 cameras) | ms | feats cos vs fp32 | e2e GT matched (6 frames, scene-0103) |
|---|---|---|---|
| fp16 (fp32 graph) | 126 | 1.00000 | 105 / 190 |
| int8 QDQ, uint8 NHWC image in, uint8 feats out | **20.9** | 0.994 | **108** / 190 (fp32 torch: 106) |

6.0x faster at the same detection quality (the feats cos of 0.994 becomes bev 0.997-0.998 and
cls/bbox >= 0.9997 after the encoder). The host quantizes the normalized image
(`round(x / 0.01866) + 114`, NHWC) where it normalizes it anyway.

### Encoder: exact rewrite first, then mixed precision

QNN's per-op profile of one fp16 encoder layer (`QNN_EXTRA='profiling_level=detailed,
profiling_file_path=...'` on `qnn_run_multi`, then `profile_ops.py`) shows the Linear layers
are not the cost: **Gemm 0.6%**, GridSample 40%, and most of the rest is elementwise work on the
SCA's (cams x queries x heads x points x 2) sampling-coordinate tensors (Gather 8.7%, Expand
5.7%, Sub 6.6%, Mul 10.9%, ...). So int8 Linears alone cannot help. First, an exact fp16 rewrite
of the SCA (`model.py`): build the grid in grid_sample's layout from its small factors (the
[0, 1] -> [-1, 1] map, the anchor repeat and the head permute on ref_cam and the offsets
*before* they broadcast), with every tensor rank <= 4 (a rank-5 broadcast version fails to
execute on the HTP, `QNN_COMMON_ERROR_SYSTEM`). validate.py vs upstream: max abs 7e-6.

| encoder | enc1 ms | enc3 ms | bev cos |
|---|---|---|---|
| fp16, as in #1849 | 104 | 241 | 0.99999 |
| fp16, SCA rewrite | **55.4** | **151** | 0.99999 |

After the rewrite GridSample is 56% of the layer (SCA 48%, TSA 9%), then Mul + ReduceSum over
the sampled values (17%). The next lever is an HVX deformable-sampling kernel (the RoiAlign
channels-last kernel is the template), not quantization: done below, "Encoder with the sampling
on the HVX" (151 -> 52 ms).

Mixed-precision policies (`quantize.py enc1 --policy ...`), strict all-HTP, enc1 vs fp32:

| policy | what | ms | cos |
|---|---|---|---|
| fp16 | - | 55.4 | 1.00000 |
| lin8 | Gemm/MatMul int8 only | 74.9 | 0.985 |
| all8 | int8 except LayerNorm, Softmax, GridSample | 68.8 | 0.971 |
| all16 | same, uint16 activations | 89.5 | 0.99998 |
| all8gs | int8 everything but LayerNorm/Softmax (GridSample int8) | 40.9 | 0.971 -> **0.991** with the [-1, 2] ref_cam clamp |
| all16gs | same, uint16 | 65.3 | 0.99998 |
| mix8 | all8gs + uint16 sampling coordinates (`sampling_coordinate_tensors`) | 78.4 | 0.994 |

Only an int8 GridSample beats fp16. Its uint8 grid is what costs accuracy (`sensitivity.py`: the
Sub/Add/Reshape feeding the grid are the worst single op types), and a uint16 grid makes
GridSample slower than fp16. Clamping ref_cam to [-1, 2] instead of [-5, 6] (still exact, max
abs 0; [-0.5, 1.5] is not) shrinks the grid range 3.7x: all8gs cos 0.971 -> 0.991. Over three
layers and six chained frames that is still a visible loss:

| whole model, scene-0103 frames 0-5 | backbone | enc3 | decoder | total | FPS | GT matched |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| fp32 torch (CPU) | | | | | | 106 / 190 |
| #1849: fp16 everywhere | 126 | 241 | 25 | 392 ms | 2.6 | 105 |
| **int8 backbone + fp16 encoder (SCA rewrite) + fp16 decoder** | 21 | 151 | 25 | **197 ms** | **5.1** | **107** |
| same, encoder all8gs | 21 | 121 | 25 | 167 ms | 6.0 | 103 (bev cos 0.98) |

The first is the default (no accuracy cost); all8gs trades 3 GT matches for 30 ms. The decoder
stays fp16: every policy was slower there (lin8 34 ms, mix8 42, all8gs 54 vs fp16 25). The
QDQ decoder has many more nodes, and its tensors are small.

`onnxsim.full_qdq` mixed-precision details that the HTP needs:
- An `exclude`d node sandwiched between quantized nodes would still form a QDQ unit (DQ in, Q
  out) and run quantized. `quantize_full_qdq` keeps its output float instead.
- A quantized node computes in its output's dtype. An input of the other dtype gets a
  DQ -> Q' -> DQ' convert; GridSample's grid is exempt. Without this, QNN rejects a Gemm with a
  uint8 input and a uint16 output, and its weight DQ is stranded on the CPU.
- Weights are quantized only for nodes that end up real QDQ units.

## Encoder with the sampling on the HVX (`msda_hvx/`)

The HTP spends 73% of an fp16 encoder layer building sampling grids, in GridSample, and in the
Mul + ReduceSum after it. That whole span, per TSA and per SCA, becomes one FastRPC call to the
generic multi-scale deformable attention kernel `../../msda_hvx/` on the CDSP's HVX; its README
has the kernel, its C API and how it got fast. The HTP keeps everything else: the Linears,
softmax, LayerNorm and the FFN. In the kernel's terms:
- **TSA** is `NV = 2` value maps (the queue) with per-map offsets (`NO = 2`), averaged.
- **SCA** is `NV = 6` cameras with shared offsets, pillar anchor `p % 4` (`R = 4`), and a
  per-(camera, query) visibility mask. 81% of the pairs are invisible on a real frame (2863 of
  15000 visible), and the kernel skips them.
- Both are one level with reference points + pixel offsets (`MSDA_REF_PIX`).

| file | what |
|---|---|
| `split.py` | BEVFormer's calls in the kernel's terms (`msda_fused`); the encoder split into 7 pieces around them (`pre`, `mid0-2`, `post0-2`). `check`: split vs `Encoder` (max abs 7e-6 on 3 frames). `dump`: real kernel calls as case directories. `export`: the pieces to ONNX + onnxsim |
| `enc_run.cpp` | the encoder on the phone: 7 HTP pieces + 6 kernel calls in one process, all tensors in rpcmem buffers ORT writes into |
| `e2e_msda.py` | backbone (int8) -> `enc_run` -> decoder on scene-0103's frames, like `e2e_phone.py`, in a phone directory of its own, every adb call under the host's phone lock (`PHONE_RUN`) |
| `build.sh` | the core's skel + stub, then `enc_run` and `qnn_run_multi` |

Checks:
- `split.py check` / `dump`, then `../../msda_hvx/msda_host_check` on all 6 calls of a real frame:
  rel <= 3.4e-6.
- `tests/test_msda_hvx.py` checks this glue against the model's own `msda_rank5` math (TSA and
  SCA), plus the kernel itself on BEVFormer-shaped synthetic calls.

Kernel alone on the phone, real frame, 4 threads, median of 10, under the phone lock:
- TSA 4.4 ms (4.8 wall incl. FastRPC);
- SCA 4.0 ms (4.4 wall).

Encoder on the phone (`enc_run`, frame 1, median of 10, burst, under the phone lock):

| step | ms |
|---|---|
| `pre` (3 layers' SCA value projections + layer 0's TSA inputs) | 6.8 |
| `mid0-2` (TSA output proj + LN + SCA offsets/weights), each | 2.3 |
| `post0-1` (SCA output proj + LN + FFN + LN + next TSA inputs), each | 5.8-6.0 |
| `post2` | 2.1 |
| TSA call, each (in-DSP / wall) | 4.5 / 4.8 |
| SCA call, each | 4.3-4.4 / 4.6 |
| **encoder** | **55.2** (HTP pieces 27.1, kernel calls 27.9 incl. 1.4 FastRPC) |

End to end (`e2e_msda.py`, scene-0103 frames 0-5, the phone's own BEV carried as prev_bev):
- **The encoder alone** (fp32 torch on the phone's own encoder inputs vs the phone's output):
  cos 0.999999 on every frame.
- **Whole model:** bev cos 0.9966-0.9980 vs fp32, cls >= 0.99979. The gap is the int8
  backbone's (feats cos 0.994), the same as with the fp16 HTP encoder.

| whole model, scene-0103 frames 0-5 | backbone | encoder | decoder | total | FPS | GT matched |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| fp32 torch (CPU) | | | | | | 106 / 190 |
| int8 backbone + fp16 HTP encoder + fp16 decoder (above) | 21 | 151 | 25 | 197 ms | 5.1 | 107 |
| **int8 backbone + split encoder (HTP + HVX MSDA) + fp16 decoder** | 21 | **55** | 24 | **100 ms** | **10.0** | **107** |

Reproduce (heavy host steps under `systemd-run ... MemoryMax=16G`):

```sh
cd msda_hvx
python3 split.py check  --ckpt $C/bevformer_tiny_epoch_24.pth --work $C/work
python3 split.py dump   --ckpt $C/bevformer_tiny_epoch_24.pth --work $C/work   # -> $C/work/msda_io/l{0,1,2}_{tsa,sca}
python3 split.py export --ckpt $C/bevformer_tiny_epoch_24.pth --work $C/work   # -> $C/work/msda_split/*.sim.onnx

  python3 e2e_msda.py --ckpt $C/bevformer_tiny_epoch_24.pth --data $C/nuscenes-mini --work $C/work --build build
```

**uint8 TSA value maps: tried, no gain in the chain.** The kernel reads uint8 value maps (see
`../../msda_hvx/README.md`), and in isolation that makes a real TSA call 9% faster (4.52 ->
4.10 ms). So:
- `split.py calib-tsa` measures per-layer ranges on quantize.py's 12 calibration frames (other
  scenes). Quantizing costs nothing measurable there: encoder cos 1.0000000 vs fp32.
- `split.py export --tsa-u8` appends a QuantizeLinear to the `tsa_v` outputs of `pre` and
  `post0/1`, so the HTP emits them as uint8 (`msda_split_u8/`, `e2e_msda.py --pieces
  msda_split_u8`).

On the phone (scene-0103, same 6 frames) it doesn't pay off:
- the encoder median over the 6 frames is 54.9 ms, vs 55.2 with fp32 values: within run-to-run
  noise (55-58 ms);
- `pre`/`post0-1` are unchanged (6.7 / 5.9 ms): the smaller outputs save nothing on the HTP side;
- the uint8 TSA calls take 4.6-5.1 ms in the chain, vs ~4.5 ms with fp32.

GT matched: 107 / 190, the same as fp32 values. fp32 values stay the default. The SCA was left on fp32: uint8 is
slower for it even in isolation.

Where the remaining 55 ms go, and the next levers:
- **The HTP pieces' graph I/O is fp32:** ~12 MB in and out per frame. Making the TSA value
  outputs uint8 didn't shorten the pieces (above). The per-piece time is dominated by the
  Linears and the fixed per-execute cost, not the output conversion.
- **`pre` computes all 3 layers' SCA value projections up front** (6.9 MB of fp32 output). They
  depend only on the image features, so they could also run in the backbone's call.
- **The kernel's multiply-accumulate phase is its larger half.** See `../../msda_hvx/README.md`.

### The whole frame in one process (`msda_hvx/frame_run.cpp`, `frame_e2e.py`)

`e2e_msda.py` runs each piece as its own process and carries tensors through the host. `frame_run`
chains backbone -> feats dequantize (CPU) -> encoder -> decoder in one process, every tensor in rpcmem,
and carries the BEV itself: prev_bev is a row gather of its own last BEV (`rot_idx.i32`, torchvision's
nearest rotate of an index image, checked exact against `rotate_prev_bev`). The host only prepares
per-frame inputs that don't depend on any output. Modes:
- `seq`: one frame at a time (latency);
- `pipe`: backbone | encoder | decoder threads, two slots between stages (throughput); its outputs are
  compared bit for bit with seq's;
- `conc`: the backbone / decoder alone, the 6 sampling calls alone, then each pair at once.

Phone, scene-0103 frames 0-5 x 5 passes, under the phone lock (`FRAME_RUN_TABLE`):

| configuration | backbone | encoder (msda) | decoder | seq ms/frame | pipe ms/frame (FPS) | pipe latency | GT matched |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| #1859 chain, one process per piece (`e2e_msda.py`) | 21 | 55 | 24 | ~100 | - | - | 107 / 190 |
| `frame_run`, backbone6 + fp16 decoder | 22.1 | 55.6 (27.7) | 25.3 | 103.2 | 97.4 (10.3) | 222 ms | 107 / 190 |
| **`frame_run`, backbone1 x 6 + fp16 decoder** | 21.3 | 55.1 (27.8) | 24.9 | 101.8 | **90.5 (11.1)** | 208 ms | **107 / 190** |
| `frame_run`, backbone1 x 6 + split decoder (HVX sampling) | 21.1 | 55.1 (27.8) | 29.9 | 106.6 | 89.7 (11.2) | 275 ms | 107 / 190 |

bev cos vs fp32 0.9965-0.9980 and cls >= 0.99979 on every frame in every row (the int8 backbone's
gap, as before); `pipe` outputs are bit-identical to `seq`'s in every configuration.

Findings:
- **The HTP and the HVX run concurrently.** The backbone takes 21.9 ms with the 6 sampling calls running
  alongside (22.0 alone); the calls take 31.2 ms (29.4 alone).
- **The HTP is the bottleneck of a pipelined frame:** ~75 ms of HTP pieces per frame (backbone 22,
  encoder pieces 28, decoder 25) against ~28 ms of HVX. So pipelining alone gives little (97 vs 103
  ms/frame); what helps is moving HTP work to the HVX.
- **A per-camera backbone pipelines better:** `quantize.py backbone` also writes `backbone1.q8` (same
  calibrated ranges; `backbone6.q8` regenerates byte-identical). Six batch-1 executes cost the same as
  one batch-6 (21.3 vs 22.1 ms) but let the encoder's HTP pieces interleave: 97.4 -> 90.5 ms/frame.
- **Decoder per-op profile (fp16):** the self-attention's softmax x V MatMul is 31% (900 x 900
  attention in layers 1-5), the deformable sampling (GridSample, grid math, ReduceSum) ~35-40%.
- **Decoder sampling on the HVX: tried, slower.** `dec_split.py` splits the decoder like the encoder
  (dpre, dmid0-4, dpost around 6 kernel calls; layer 0's inputs are constants; torch split vs
  `Decoder` max abs 0). On the phone it takes 29.9 ms vs 24.9 for the fp16 graph, with the same
  accuracy: seven fp32-I/O pieces and six RPCs cost more than the GridSample they replace at 900
  queries x 4 points. The fp16 graph stays the default. The self-attention is the bigger decoder cost.

Next levers (not done here):
- the HTP pieces' ~75 ms/frame is the pipelined bottleneck: int8 on the encoder pieces' Linears now
  that GridSample is off the HTP (the earlier int8-encoder loss came from the GridSample grid), and
  int8 on the decoder's self-attention matmuls;
- the encoder's `pre` (6.8 ms, 3 layers' SCA value projections) could fold into the backbone graph.

### Follow-up levers on the frame runner (`msda_hvx/quantize_split.py`, `frame_e2e.py --pieces`)

Phone, scene-0103 frames 0-5 x 5 passes, `frame_run` with backbone1 x 6 + fp16 decoder, under the phone
lock (same session as the baseline row, which reproduces #1879's 90.5 ms):

| encoder HTP pieces | host bev cos vs fp32 (scene-0103 / calib) | encoder (msda) | seq ms/frame | pipe ms/frame (FPS) | phone bev cos | GT matched |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **fp16 (`msda_split`, default)** | - | **54.4 (27.4)** | **101.3** | **89.6 (11.2)** | 0.9965-0.9980 | **107 / 190** |
| int8 except LayerNorm/Softmax (`all8`) | 0.99754 / 0.99727 | slower* | - | - | 0.9941-0.9956 | 108 / 190 |
| `all8`, sampling offsets uint16 (`all8o16`) | 0.99810 / 0.99785 | 73.2 (27.5) | 120.2 | 108.3 (9.2) | - | 110 / 190 |
| int8 Gemm/MatMul only (`lin8`) | 0.99821 / 0.99768 | 102.6 (28.2) | 150.1 | 137.0 (7.3) | - | 107 / 190 |

\* `all8` was measured while the phone was contended (the baseline read 216 ms/frame pipelined in the
same run), so only its accuracy counts; it is also below the 0.996 bev-cos bar.

**Lever 1, int8 encoder pieces: accurate now, but slower on the HTP.** With the sampling on the HVX,
int8 no longer costs accuracy: `all8o16` even matches 110 GT, and host bev cos is 0.998. But every int8
variant makes the encoder slower (54 -> 73 -> 103 ms): the pieces are small (2500 x 256 Linears), their
graph I/O is fp32, and each QDQ unit adds per-op conversion work that the int8 matmuls don't win back.
fp16 stays the default. (Uint8 graph I/O would need frame_run to carry uint8 buffers between pieces; the
earlier uint8 TSA-output test saved nothing on the HTP side, so it is not pursued here.)

**Lever 2, decoder self-attention int8 / 16-bit** (`quantize.py decoder --policy mm8|mm16`: only the
decoder's 10 activation x activation MatMuls, i.e. Q x K^T and softmax x V of layers 1-5):

| decoder | decoder ms | seq ms/frame | pipe ms/frame (FPS) | cls cos (min) | GT matched |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **fp16 (`decoder.sim`, default)** | **25.0** | **101.9** | **90.2 (11.1)** | 0.99979 | **107 / 190** |
| `mm8` | 24.0 | 100.9 | 90.0 (11.1) | 0.99965 | 107 / 190 |
| `mm16` | 27.0 | 103.5 | 92.1 (10.9) | 0.99979 | 107 / 190 |

`mm8` saves 1 ms of decoder time at the same GT, but the pipelined frame doesn't move (the HTP total per
frame is ~75 ms, and 1 ms is within run-to-run noise), so fp16 stays the default.

**Lever 3, fold `pre` into the backbone: bounded, not done.** Timed alone on the HTP (`qnn_run_multi`,
median of 20): `pre` 6.46 ms, `pre` without the SCA value projections 4.97 ms, the SCA value projections
alone 1.58 ms. Folding moves those ~1.5 ms of HTP work into the backbone graph rather than removing it,
and makes the backbone's output 3x larger (3 layers' `sca_v` instead of `feats`). The ceiling is
therefore < 1.5 ms of a 90 ms pipelined frame, for a frame_run change; not worth it.

**Lever 4, backbone recalibration** (`quantize.py backbone --method mse|percentile`, same graph, only the
scales change, so the speed is unchanged):

| backbone calibration | phone bev cos (min / max) | GT matched |
|---|---|---|
| **minmax (default)** | 0.9965 / 0.9980 | **107 / 190** |
| mse | 0.9970 / 0.9979 | 104 / 190 |
| percentile (99.999) | 0.9971 / 0.9980 | 105 / 190 |

mse and percentile raise bev cos slightly but match fewer GT boxes: minmax stays.

**Where this leaves BEVFormer-tiny:** 89.6-90.2 ms/frame pipelined (11.1-11.2 FPS), 107/190 GT. The
pipelined frame is bounded by ~75 ms of HTP work that neither int8 (slower on these small pieces) nor
re-partitioning shrinks. The remaining lever is moving more HTP work to the HVX, where the kernel has
headroom (~28 ms per frame).

Phone-contention note: the Mask R-CNN demo app (`org.onnxsim.maskrcnndemo`) was running on the phone
during parts of this session and slowed the HTP ~2x. Every timing in the tables above was taken with the
app idle (checked with `top` right after each run); runs taken while it was busy were discarded.

### Why not a `scripts/android/deploy` spec (yet)

The deploy pipeline (#1853) takes one graph through fetch -> simplify -> quantize -> rewrite ->
bench -> accuracy, with images as calibration/eval data and a detection-match accuracy. Four
things are missing for BEVFormer, none small:
- **a chain of pieces**: backbone6 -> enc3 -> decoder, each with its own precision policy, where
  the backbone's uint8 feats feed the encoder;
- **host inputs per frame**: ref_cam/bev_mask from lidar2img, can_bus, shift;
- **temporal state**: the previous BEV, rotated and shifted on the host, is an encoder input;
- **nuScenes data and a 3D accuracy kind**: calibration/eval frames, and GT matching in the ego
  frame.

`quantize.py` + `e2e_phone.py` cover all four for this model. The piece that generalizes is the
quantizer: the deploy spec's `quantize` section could call `onnxsim.full_qdq.quantize_full_qdq`
(`op_types` / `exclude_nodes` / `tensor_dtypes` map directly onto spec keys).

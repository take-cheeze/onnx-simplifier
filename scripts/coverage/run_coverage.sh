# Collect combined C++ + Python code coverage for onnxsim from a single pytest
# run.
#
# onnxsim is a hybrid project: the C++ in onnxsim/*.cpp / *.cc is compiled into
# the `onnxsim_cpp2py_export` extension, and the Python in onnxsim/*.py drives
# it. A pytest run exercises both halves in one process, so we can measure both
# at once:
#
#   * Python -> coverage.py (pytest-cov) instruments the .py modules.
#   * C++    -> the extension is built with --coverage (gcov). Every C++ line
#              that runs behind the extension writes a .gcda profile into the
#              build directory, which gcovr turns into a report afterwards.
#
# Reports land in a coverage output directory (default: ./coverage-report):
#
#   coverage-report/python.xml   Cobertura XML  (Python, coverage.py)
#   coverage-report/python-html/ HTML           (Python)
#   coverage-report/cpp.xml      Cobertura XML  (C++, gcovr)
#   coverage-report/cpp.html     HTML           (C++, gcovr --html-details)
#
# Both XML files are Cobertura, so a single upload step (Codecov, Coveralls,
# Sonar, ...) can ingest them together for a unified C++/Python view.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/coverage/run_coverage.sh [pytest args...]
#
# Environment overrides:
#   COV_OUTPUT_DIR   where reports are written        (default: ./coverage-report)
#   COV_SKIP_BUILD   set to 1 to reuse an existing coverage build
#   COV_PYTEST_ARGS  default pytest args when none are passed on the CLI
#                    (default: "tests")
#
# Prerequisites: a GCC/Clang toolchain, cmake, ninja, and the Python packages
#   pytest pytest-cov gcovr
# plus whatever the tests themselves import (onnxruntime, torch, ...).

#    `--cov-branch` records branch (decision) coverage too. Without it coverage.py
#    collects lines only and writes branches-valid="0" into python.xml, which the
#    combined summary renders as a misleading 0% branch rate for the Python side
#    (gcov measures C++ branches by default, so only the Python half was blank).

# 4. Turn the accumulated .gcda profiles into C++ coverage reports. --root keeps
#    paths repo-relative; the filters restrict the report to onnxsim's own C++
#    (dropping vendored ONNX / onnxruntime and system headers).
#
#    --gcov-ignore-parse-errors=suspicious_hits.warn: a hot loop exercised
#    across the whole suite can accumulate a hit count so large (billions) that
#    gcov emits a value gcovr 8.x flags as "suspicious" and, by default, aborts
#    the whole run over (exit 64). Those counts are legitimate, so downgrade the
#    suspicious-hit error to a warning and keep going.
#
#    --exclude-directory '.*/_deps/.*': skip gcov'ing CMake's FetchContent
#    dependencies (protobuf, abseil, ...) entirely. Their .gcda/.gcno end up
#    stale relative to each other under sccache (a cache-hit replays an old
#    object's notes file, which can carry a stamp that no longer matches this
#    run's .gcda), and gcov then reports a "stamp mismatch with notes file" /
#    "could not write output file" for those files. Those deps are already
#    dropped from the report by --filter above, so there's nothing to lose by
#    not gcov'ing them -- and it removes the flaky trigger instead of merely
#    tolerating it.
#
#    --gcov-ignore-errors=output_error --gcov-ignore-errors=no_working_dir_found:
#    belt-and-suspenders for any other file gcovr can't cleanly gcov (e.g. the
#    same stamp-mismatch class of error surfacing somewhere --exclude-directory
#    doesn't cover). Without this, gcovr treats a single bad file as fatal for
#    the whole run (exit 64) instead of just dropping that file's coverage.
#    (--gcov-ignore-errors takes one choice per flag, so it's repeated rather
#    than comma-separated.)

"""Emit real QAT step graphs as ONNX fixtures, for the execution-provider test.

``onnxsim/qat_graph.py`` pins the operators a step graph may contain
(``EP_FRIENDLY_OPS``) and justifies the set by claiming those operators have
coverage on onnxruntime-web's WebGPU backend and the WebNN/NPU execution
providers. Three python test files assert that the emitted graphs stay inside
the set; nothing checked that the set is *right*. ``step_graph_ep.test.mjs``
does -- by loading these graphs into onnxruntime-web and running them on every
execution provider it can reach.

The graphs here are produced by the library's own builders, never hand-written,
so a fixture cannot drift into describing a step graph onnxsim does not emit:

  * ``step_adaround.onnx``     -- ``onnxsim.adaround._build_rounding_step_graph``
  * ``step_adaquant.onnx``     -- ``onnxsim.adaquant._build_adaquant_step_graph``
  * ``step_qat_backward.onnx`` -- ``onnxsim.graph_grad.build_backward`` composed
    with ``qat_graph.adam_update``/``make_step_graph``, the way
    ``onnxsim.qat._build_step_graph`` composes them. The forward slice is
    written here rather than sliced out of a quantized model (which would drag
    in the whole ``apply_qat`` pipeline for no extra operator coverage), and is
    deliberately built from ``EP_FRIENDLY_OPS`` members only, so the *whole*
    fixture stays inside the set under test. A real ``apply_qat`` step graph
    embeds its block's forward nodes verbatim and can therefore contain ops
    outside the set (``Relu``, ``Softmax``, ...); that is a property of the
    caller's model, not of what the builders emit, and is out of scope here.
  * ``step_minibatch.onnx``    -- ``qat_graph.GraphBuilder.gather_rows`` reading
    a minibatch out of a resident calibration set, which is the only thing
    ``Gather`` is in the allowlist for. It is also the only fixture with a
    *non-float* input (the rank-1 int64 row index, declared through
    ``make_step_graph``'s ``per_step``), and therefore the one most likely to
    find a backend limit: int64 is exactly what onnxruntime-web's WebNN backend
    is known to reject.

Between them the three cover every operator in ``EP_FRIENDLY_OPS`` -- the
script asserts that, so the set growing a member with no fixture behind it
fails here rather than going quietly unverified.

Each graph is accompanied, in ``step_graphs.json``, by the values to feed it
(constants, initial state, and the per-step scalars), the state wiring
``run_step_graph`` closes the loop with, and the loss trajectory the same feeds
produce through onnxruntime's CPU provider in Python. The Node test replays
exactly that loop and compares, so "onnxruntime-web on this EP agrees with
onnxruntime on CPU" is a numeric check rather than a claim.

A fifth graph, ``step_qat_hf_demo.onnx`` (``build_qat_hf_demo``, below), is
generated here too but is not part of the ``step_graphs.json`` manifest or
``step_graph_ep.test.mjs``'s own EP-coverage measurement -- it is driven with
*live* data (a real Hugging Face photo) by a different consumer,
``webgpu_hf_demo.test.mjs``; see that function's own docstring for why it
needs its own file. ``step_train_loop_demo.onnx`` (``build_train_loop_demo``)
is the same idea for ``onnxsim.compile_training_loop`` -- baked data this
time, but still its own file, since it too is driven by a browser-only
consumer (``webgpu_train_loop_demo.test.mjs``) rather than
``step_graph_ep.test.mjs``.

Regenerate (from this directory, with onnxsim importable from the repo root)::

    python3 make_step_graph_fixtures.py

Rerun it after changing any of the four builders; the committed ``.onnx``
files are the point of the fixture, so they must be regenerated and committed
deliberately rather than rebuilt at test time.

    Hugging Face dataset, inside a real browser, on WebGPU. This script runs
    in plain Python with no network access and has no opinion about what that
    photo will be -- it only fixes the *shape* of the problem.

    The forward is deliberately smaller than ``build_qat_backward``'s (two
    ``MatMul``s, two ``Add``s, one ``Sigmoid`` -- all already covered by other
    fixtures, so this adds no new operator to verify) and takes a flattened
    8x8 grayscale image (64 features) down to a single scalar, regressed
    toward a fixed zero target. "Fit a real photo to zero" is an arbitrary
    objective, not a meaningful one -- chosen because it needs no labels, only
    a real ``x``, which is all ``hf_datasets.mjs`` promises. What this proves
    is that the whole pipeline (a real photo in, a real gradient/Adam step
    graph, WebGPU execution) runs end to end and the loss actually moves.

    Structurally this differs from ``build_qat_hf_demo`` only in shape: ``x``
    gains a batch dimension (``num_samples`` real photos flattened+grayscaled

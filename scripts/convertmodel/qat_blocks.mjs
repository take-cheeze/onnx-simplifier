// Block discovery for the converter page's "Fine-tune (QAT)" panel.
//
// onnxsim_qat_build_step_graph names a block the way onnxsim.apply_qat does:
// by two tensor names, its input and its output. A user can type them, but on
// a real model nobody knows them offhand -- so this module proposes them,
// porting onnxsim/qat.py's discover_qat_blocks (_liveness_cuts /
// _primary_graph_input and the span walk over them) to JavaScript, reading the
// model bytes directly with the same dependency-free protobuf wire reader
// macs.mjs and shapes.mjs already share.
//
// It is a liveness argument rather than a pattern match, and that is the whole
// substance: walk the nodes in graph order tracking which activations are
// live at each gap, and cut wherever exactly one is. A slice bounded that way
// is self-contained, so it can be lifted out and differentiated on its own --
// which means residual connections *place* the boundaries instead of defeating
// them (inside `y = f(x) + x` the skip tensor is live alongside every
// intermediate, so the first cut after `x` is the residual Add's own output).
// qat.py's own docstrings carry the full argument; this is the port, not a
// second derivation of it.
//
// **Where this port is deliberately weaker than the Python.** Python closes a
// block after `max_layers_per_block` *quantized* layers, which it knows from
// qat.py's _find_layers matching the float model's layers against the
// quantized model's. There is no binding for that -- the wasm module exposes
// BuildQatStepGraph and WriteBackQatState and nothing else of qat.py -- so a
// "layer" here is a float-side weight-bearing op instead: a MatMul/Gemm/Conv
// with a constant (initializer) weight, which is the population every
// quantizer in onnxsim draws its layers from. The two agree except at the
// margins each scheme adds (quantize_weight_only_int4 skips a MatMul whose
// reduction axis is not a multiple of 32, say), so a proposal can occasionally
// merge one span too few or too many. That costs block granularity, not
// correctness: BuildQatStepGraph refuses a block with no layer of the
// requested scheme in it, loudly, and the panel reports the refusal and moves
// to the next block.
//
// Field numbers below are from onnx.proto:
//   ModelProto     graph = 7
//   GraphProto     node = 1, initializer = 5, input = 11, output = 12
//   NodeProto      input = 1, output = 2, name = 3, op_type = 4
//   TensorProto    name = 8
//   ValueInfoProto name = 1

import { fields, decode } from "./macs.mjs";

// onnxsim.graph_grad.SUPPORTED_OPS -- the op types build_backward has a
// gradient rule for, and therefore the only ops a block may contain. It tracks
// graph_grad.py's _RULES table and graph_grad.cpp's Rules(), which are the same
// table on both sides. A span containing anything else is a gap between blocks
// rather than a failed model, which is what makes whole-model discovery usable
// at all.
//
// This is a pre-filter, not the authority: BuildQatStepGraph checks the real
// table and refuses a block whose ops it cannot differentiate, naming them. So
// a list that lags a newly added rule costs block granularity (that op becomes
// a gap), and a list that runs ahead of one costs a proposed block that is then
// refused and skipped with its reason -- neither trains anything wrongly.

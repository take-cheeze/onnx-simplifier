// The driving half of LoRA/QLoRA fine-tuning in the browser, for the
// converter page's "Fine-tune (LoRA)" panel (lora_ui.mjs).
//
// onnxsim/lora_entry.h splits the feature in two on purpose, and for the same
// reason qat_entry.h does (see qat_finetune.mjs's own top comment): building
// the step graph -- and, for LoRA, injecting the adapter in the first place --
// is graph surgery and lives in wasm (onnxsim_lora_inject /
// _build_step_graph / _write_back / _release_plan, see interface.cpp), while
// *running* the step graph is an ordinary inference loop and belongs wherever
// the inference runtime is -- here, on onnxruntime-web. lora_entry.h's own
// "intended browser flow" comment is the contract this file implements:
//
//   1. inject a trainable low-rank branch into the base model, getting back
//      the injected model and the LoraAdapter it produced;
//   2. build the step graph for one block (ordinarily the whole model --
//      InjectLora already applies globally in one pass, so there is no
//      per-layer boundary to discover the way QAT's blocks need one), getting
//      back its state ping-pong map, the activations to capture, the
//      per-step scalars and the initial state tensors (the adapter's
//      *current* A/B values, so a partially trained adapter resumes rather
//      than restarts);
//   3. capture those activations -- the block's own externals from the
//      *injected* model, and the reconstruction target from a *reference*
//      model, which is why this is two model sessions rather than QAT's one
//      (see captureLoraActivations below) -- bind them plus the initial
//      state, and run the step graph `n` times, feeding the per-step scalars
//      and carrying each state output back into its state input;
//   4. write the final state back into the injected model, and release the
//      plan.
//
// **Reused rather than reimplemented.** `adamBiasCorrections`,
// `minibatchIndices`, `bindCaptures`, `finalStateForWriteBack`,
// `runStepLoop`, `captureActivations`, `buildCalibrationRows` and
// `renderLossCurve` are imported straight from qat_finetune.mjs. None of the
// seven does anything QAT-specific: the bias-correction formula, the seeded
// minibatch stream, the input/output binding conventions, the state
// ping-pong loop, running a model over calibration rows to capture named
// tensors, and the loss-curve SVG are the same mechanics LoraStepPlan asks
// for -- LoraStepPlan's own top comment in lora_entry.h says as much
// ("Mirrors qat_entry.h's QatStepPlan, minus everything that exists there
// only for the two quantized schemes"). Re-implementing them here would be a
// second copy of the same minibatch wraparound arithmetic and xorshift
// permutation to keep in sync by hand; importing them keeps the one copy
// that qat_finetune.test.mjs already exercises authoritative for both
// panels. What genuinely differs -- LoRA's own scalar schedule (one learning
// rate, not three), the injection step, dual-model capture, and the plan's
// extra `parameters` field -- is written fresh below.
//
// The same two contract details qat_finetune.mjs's own top comment flags are
// load-bearing here too: a capture binds to its `input`, never its `source`;
// and `stepGraph` and every `initialState.data` (plus, for LoRA,
// `model` from the injection step) are views over wasm buffers the next call
// reuses, copied out immediately.

//
// - `targetData == null` (reference-model distillation, the default): the

//   is run once per model (when each has captures to make) and the results
//   merged, rather than once as QAT does.
// - `targetData != null`: the caller-supplied loss targets themselves
//   (train_lora's `target_data` mode -- real supervised fine-tuning against
//   labels, not reproducing a reference model). `referenceBytes` is not
//   required or used in this mode; the reference model is never run.
//   `targetData` is one array (or typed array) per `rowFeeds` entry, exactly

//   are stacked into `{ dims, data }` the same shape captureActivations
//   itself produces, directly here rather than via a model run.

// non-teacher capture is a graph input of the injected model, so

// model is not actually run at all in that case; only the reference model is

"""Static op-support heuristic for MIT HAN Lab's TinyEngine code generator.

`mit-han-lab/tinyengine <https://github.com/mit-han-lab/tinyengine>`_ is a
source-code generator that compiles a quantized model straight to C for
ARMv7E-M (Cortex-M) microcontrollers. **It has no NPU and nothing to do with
TI's edgeai/TIDL** -- an earlier request in this project's history conflated
a "~2.5 GOPS NPU" figure with TI's accelerator when it actually referred to
this project instead, and TinyEngine has no accelerator of any kind. It is
a pure-CPU inference *compiler*: the C it emits for each op *is* the runtime
implementation, generated ahead of time, not dispatched to a library at
run time.

**This is also not the same thing as "TI's TinyEngine NPU"**, a genuinely
different, unrelated hardware product Texas Instruments announced in March
2026 (a dedicated NPU silicon block for its MSPM0G5187/AM13Ex MCUs, built
on a TVM-based toolchain) that happens to share this project's name --
see ``scripts/tinyengine/README.md`` for the full disambiguation and the
correction history.

Two structural differences from every other ``scripts/<vendor>/*_ops.py`` in
this repo matter enough to shape this whole module:

1. **It ingests TFLite, not ONNX.** ``code_generator/TfliteConvertor.py``
   reads a ``.tflite`` flatbuffer and walks its op list; there is no ONNX
   importer at all. This repository has no ONNX->TFLite conversion step, so
   this heuristic works the way ``scripts/edgeai/tidl_ops.py``'s QOperator
   check does for a *different* format mismatch: it maps each ONNX op type
   to the TFLite builtin op(s) it would plausibly become after conversion,
   and checks *that* against TinyEngine's real dispatch table. This is an
   approximation of a conversion step that never actually runs here -- a
   "would this survive conversion and match the whitelist", not a
   guarantee, exactly the caveat ``tidl_ops.py`` gives for its own
   heuristic.
2. **There is no fallback path.** TIDL, QNN, OpenVINO and friends all fall
   an unsupported op back to a host CPU implementation and keep going.
   TinyEngine cannot: it has no separate "for anything else" runtime to
   fall back to, because the generated C is the only implementation that
   will ever exist for that graph. ``TfliteConvertor.py``'s
   ``_handleOperator`` method (the dispatch every op in the graph passes
   through) ends its if/elif chain with a plain
   ``else: raise NotImplementedError(f"Unsupported {op_code_str}")`` --
   confirmed by reading that method directly, not inferred. One
   unrecognized op anywhere in the graph fails the whole compile. There is
   no such thing as "partial coverage, rest on CPU fallback" here the way
   ``tidl_backend.coverage()`` means it -- "partial" for TinyEngine means
   "will not compile at all".

What ``_handleOperator`` actually dispatches on (read directly from
``code_generator/TfliteConvertor.py`` and ``code_generator/constant.py`` in
the real repo, not reconstructed from the TFLite schema's op enum -- see
point 3 below for why that distinction matters):

- ``CONV_2D`` / ``DEPTHWISE_CONV_2D`` -- both routed through the same
  ``TF_Parser.parse_conv2d``, keyed only on which BuiltinOperator each node
  actually carries; not distinguished by depthwise-ness at this dispatch
  level.
- ``ADD``, ``AVERAGE_POOL_2D``, ``MAX_POOL_2D``, ``FULLY_CONNECTED``,
  ``TRANSPOSE`` (via ``_convert_TRANSPOSE``), ``PAD`` (via ``_convert_PAD``),
  ``RESIZE_NEAREST_NEIGHBOR``, and ``MEAN`` (via ``parse_mead1dto2d`` --
  yes, that is the real function's name in the source, a 1D-to-2D mean
  reshape, not a typo introduced here).
- ``op_code_str in SKIP_OPs: pass`` -- ``constant.py`` defines
  ``SKIP_OPs = {"QUANTIZE", "DEQUANTIZE", "RESHAPE"}``. These ops are not
  rejected, but nothing is generated for them either: the node is silently
  dropped from the emitted C. That is exactly right for `QUANTIZE`/
  `DEQUANTIZE` (TinyEngine's whole point is to run natively quantized, so
  the fixed-point representation these ops describe is what every other
  op already assumes) but ``constant.py`` itself carries a
  ``# TODO: Handle RESHAPE during codegen`` comment right above the
  ``RESHAPE`` entry -- i.e. TinyEngine's own authors flag that skipping a
  reshape's actual data movement is not always safe, only convenient. This
  module treats ``Reshape`` as supported-but-flagged, not silently clean --
  see ``RESHAPE_SKIP_CAVEAT`` below.
- **``MUL`` has no case of its own.** It only appears indirectly, in a
  *lookahead* the convertor runs when it sees a ``DEPTHWISE_CONV_2D``:
  ``checkIfRequireSEelementmult`` scans the next few ops for the exact
  three-op sequence ``ADD -> MUL -> MUL`` and, if found, fuses that triple
  via ``TF_Parser.parse_SEelement`` as a squeeze-and-excite gate (the
  ``Add``/``Clip``-as-hard-sigmoid-numerator, ``Mul``-by-1/6, ``Mul``-onto-
  the-main-branch pattern real SE blocks use). A ``Mul`` anywhere else --
  including the extremely common Sigmoid/HardSigmoid-gated Swish/SiLU
  activation (``scripts/common/synthetic_models.sigmoid_mul_swish``) --
  has no dispatch case and falls into the same hard
  ``NotImplementedError`` as any other unrecognized op.
- Every other builtin op code, and anything ``_handleOperator`` cannot even
  attempt to look up, hits that terminal ``else`` and fails the whole
  conversion.

3. **A schema entry is not support.** ``code_generator/tflite/
   BuiltinOperator.py`` (TinyEngine's own vendored, schema-generated
   bindings) defines an enum value for ``PRELU``, ``LEAKY_RELU``, ``MUL``,
   ``RELU``, and dozens of other ops that appear nowhere in
   ``_handleOperator``'s dispatch above. The generated bindings describe
   what the *TFLite format* can represent, not what *this specific code
   generator* implements -- having a real, valid opcode is necessary but
   nowhere near sufficient. ``UNSUPPORTED_WITH_REAL_TFLITE_OPCODE`` below
   names a few of these deliberately, specifically because a schema lookup
   alone would wrongly suggest they're fine.

Fused activations are the other real subtlety. TFLite's own ``Conv2D``/
``DepthwiseConv2D`` op carries its activation as a
``FusedActivationFunction`` field on the *same* op (``Conv2DOptions.py``'s
``Conv2DOptionsAddFusedActivationFunction``) -- a `Relu`/`Relu6` (`Clip(0,
6)` in ONNX terms) immediately following a conv is not a separate TFLite
node at all once real conversion tooling fuses it in, so
``_handleOperator`` never sees it as its own op. A `Relu`/`Clip` that is
*not* the sole, immediate consumer of a `Conv` output is not eligible for
that fusion and, like `Mul`, has no standalone dispatch case -- so it would
surface as a real op in the `.tflite` graph and hit the same
`NotImplementedError`. ``is_fusable_activation`` below approximates that
one condition (immediate, sole consumer of a `Conv`) since this repository
never runs a real converter to confirm the fusion actually happens.

See ``scripts/tinyengine/README.md`` for the full survey (real published
latency numbers included) and exactly which of this module's checks are
exact ports of something read in the source versus a necessary
approximation because no ONNX->TFLite conversion runs here.

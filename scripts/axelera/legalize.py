"""Rewrites that make a graph's use of `auto_pad`/`transA`/`storage_order`
explicit, matching Voyager SDK's own opset-17 AIPU acceleration constraints
(`voyager_ops.py`, scraped from its docs by `scrape_onnx_support_docs.py`).

`voyager_simulator.evaluate_constraints()` is a docs-derived, no-hardware
estimate of those constraints (see its docstring for exactly what it does
and does not claim) -- op *coverage* the same way `pulsar2_ops.py` is for
Axera. For three of its documented rules, the fix is not "avoid this op",
it is a rewrite that is exact, not an approximation:

- **`Conv`/`AveragePool`/`MaxPool` need `auto_pad == "NOTSET"`.** ONNX
  defines each `auto_pad` mode (`SAME_UPPER`, `SAME_LOWER`, `VALID`) as a
  formula over the input's spatial shape (see the ONNX operator spec for
  `Conv`). Computing that formula once and writing the result out as
  explicit `pads` with `auto_pad = "NOTSET"` changes nothing about what the
  op computes, only how the padding amount is spelled -- the two forms are
  defined to agree.
- **`Gemm` needs `transA == 0`.** `transA = 1` means "transpose A before the
  matmul"; inserting an explicit `Transpose` node ahead of the `Gemm` and
  clearing the flag is the same operation, spelled as two nodes instead of
  one attribute.
- **`MaxPool` needs `storage_order == 0`.** The attribute only orders the
  *second*, optional `Indices` output; a graph that never produces that
  output computes an identical first output (`Y`) whichever way
  `storage_order` is set, so forcing it to 0 there is a free rewrite rather
  than a behavior change.

Unlike `scripts/axera/legalize.py`'s rules -- each bisected against a real
`pulsar2 build` failure on real hardware -- nothing here has been checked
against an actual Voyager SDK compile. `axelera-rt`/`axelera-devkit`
(`voyager_backend.py`) do install from a public index per Voyager SDK's own
docs, but it's a large, optional pull (torch, CUDA toolkit packages, TVM)
not exercised for this file. What backs these three rules instead is
`voyager_ops.py`'s own scraped constraint text and
`voyager_simulator.evaluate_constraints()`, derived from the same docs and
itself partially cross-checked against the real compiler (see
`voyager_backend.py`'s docstring) -- each rule's test checks that the
target node's verdict against that checker moves from `"violated"` to
`"ok"`, and separately that `onnx.reference.ReferenceEvaluator` gives the
same output before and after. That is real, mechanical verification that
the graph now reads as compliant and still computes the same thing; it is
not a substitute for an actual `axelera.compiler` run.

Each of these three rules also has a C++ counterpart in onnxsim's own core
(`onnxsim/passes/explicit_auto_pad.h`, `gemm_transa_to_transpose.h`,
`maxpool_rowmajor_when_indices_unused.h`). Those core passes are
deliberately generic and target-agnostic -- they carry no mention of
Voyager SDK or Axelera at all, only the ONNX-legal rewrite itself and the
*kind* of backend limitation it answers (explicit-padding-only, `transA`-
unsupported, row-major-only). This file is the legalizer: the place that
knows *this* target needs all three, and why (the constraint text and
evaluator above). Registered as opt-in
`PassType::Other` optimizers -- `onnxsim.simplify(model,
extra_optimizers=["explicit_auto_pad", "gemm_transA_to_transpose",
"maxpool_rowmajor_when_indices_unused"])`, or `--enable-optimization
<name>` from the CLI -- so the same rewrites are available from every
onnxsim binding (Python, C, Rust, npm/WASM), not only as a script run
against a standalone `onnx.ModelProto`. This file stays useful on its own:
it needs nothing beyond the `onnx` package (no onnxsim build), and its
module-level functions compose freely with `legalize()`/`RULES` for
scripting. See `tests/test_explicit_auto_pad.py`,
`tests/test_gemm_transa_to_transpose.py` and
`tests/test_maxpool_rowmajor_when_indices_unused.py` for the C++ passes'
own tests.

A third option needs neither a rebuild nor a standalone script step:
`as_custom_rewriter()` adapts `legalize()` to `onnxsim.simplify`'s existing
`custom_rewriter` parameter, so these rules run *inside* the same
simplification fixed point from any already-installed `onnxsim` --
`onnxsim.simplify(model, custom_rewriter=legalize.as_custom_rewriter())`.
See that function's docstring for when to reach for it over
`extra_optimizers`.

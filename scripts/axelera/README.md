# Axelera Voyager SDK / Metis AIPU compatibility check

A docs-derived, no-hardware/no-Docker estimate of whether a graph is
friendly to Axelera AI's [Voyager SDK](https://github.com/axelera-ai-hub/voyager-sdk)
(`deploy.py`, which compiles ONNX models to `.axmodel` for Metis AIPU
devices), and of whether `onnxsim.simplify()` stays safe to run ahead of it.

Also see the ["Deploying to Axelera Metis devices" section](../../README.md#deploying-to-axelera-metis-devices-voyager-sdk)
of the top-level README, and `tests/test_voyager_sdk_patterns.py` (onnxsim's
own compatibility tests against Voyager SDK's Focus/Reshape+Gemm graph
rewriter, in the main `tests/` directory) for the structural-simplification
side of this. This directory is about the AIPU op-support side instead.

## What this actually is, and isn't

Voyager SDK publishes a real per-operator AIPU support reference
(`docs/reference/compiler/onnx-support.md` and its per-opset detail pages,
auto-generated from Axelera's own operator acceleration definitions) --
including formal `rule`/`allow_config` predicates for most "Constrained"
operators, not just an op-type list. `scrape_onnx_support_docs.py` scrapes
that into `voyager_op_support_data.py`; `voyager_ops.py` and
`voyager_simulator.py` turn it into a queryable partition + a best-effort
per-node constraint evaluator -- all of that **without** any real compiler.

There is also a real backend now: **`voyager_backend.py`** wraps Voyager
SDK's actual `axelera.compiler.quantize()`. An earlier version of this
README claimed the real compiler was unreachable here (proprietary,
credentials-only) -- that was wrong. `axelera-rt`/`axelera-devkit` install
from a genuinely public Artifactory PyPI mirror with no login, exactly as
voyager-sdk's own `docs/user-guides/sdk-install.md` documents:

```bash
pip install --extra-index-url https://software.axelera.ai/artifactory/api/pypi/axelera-pypi/simple axelera-rt axelera-devkit[all]
```

(This is a large, optional install -- it pulls torch, several CUDA toolkit
packages, TVM, and more. Nothing in onnxsim's own test suite or CI requires
it.) Running it for real turned up two concrete things:

- Quantizing a `Conv -> BatchNormalization -> Relu` graph and its
  onnxsim-simplified `Conv -> Relu` form (BN fused into Conv) through the
  real quantizer produces **bit-identical** output.
- A `Conv` with `auto_pad="SAME_UPPER"` (violating the scraped rule
  `auto_pad == "NOTSET"`) makes `quantize()` fail outright, and the real
  compiler's own warning quotes that *exact* constraint string --
  confirming `voyager_op_support_data.py` matches the compiler's actual
  internal check, and correcting `onnx-support.md`'s own "falls back to
  host CPU" framing: that's what happens for an *undocumented* op type, not
  for a documented-but-violated "Constrained" one.

See `voyager_backend.py`'s module docstring for the full account (including
what still doesn't work here -- `axelera.compiler.compile()`, i.e. real
deployable `.axmodel` artifacts, needs a "device support directory" this
environment doesn't have), and `tests/test_axelera_voyager_real_compiler.py`
for these pinned as regression tests (skipped automatically if
`axelera.compiler` isn't installed).

`voyager_ops.py`/`voyager_simulator.py` stay docs-only by design even
though the real compiler turned out to be reachable -- they're useful
exactly because they don't need the heavy optional install. Read their
output as an estimate corroborated by, but not equivalent to, what
`voyager_backend.py` (better) or the real `deploy.py` (authoritative) would
say.

## Usage

```python
import sys

sys.path.insert(0, "scripts/axelera")  # or run from this directory

import onnx
import voyager_simulator as sim

model = onnx.load("model.onnx")

print(sim.coverage(model))  # 'full' | 'partial' | 'none', by op-type membership alone
p = sim.partition(model)
print(p.npu_node_fraction, p.cpu_fallback_op_types)

for result in sim.evaluate_all_constraints(model):
    if result.verdict == "violated":
        # observed, for at least one op: quantize() fails outright here,
        # not a graceful CPU fallback -- see voyager_backend.py's docstring
        print(result.op_type, "violates a documented constraint:", result.detail)
    elif result.verdict == "unknown":
        print(result.op_type, "constraint not statically checkable here")
```

With the real compiler installed (see above), cross-check against it directly:

```python
import voyager_backend as backend

if backend.has_axelera_compiler():
    result = backend.compare_before_after_simplify(
        model, simplified_model, calibration_dataset_fn, test_input
    )
    print(result["bit_identical"], result["max_abs_diff"])
```

## Legalizing: fixing what `evaluate_constraints()` finds

`legalize.py` holds semantics-preserving rewrites for three of the scraped
constraints -- the ones with a fix that's an exact rewrite, not just
"avoid this op": `Conv`/`AveragePool`/`MaxPool`'s `auto_pad == "NOTSET"`
requirement (this is the same rule the real compiler's own warning quoted
back, above), `Gemm`'s `transA == 0`, and `MaxPool`'s `storage_order == 0`
when the `Indices` output goes unused. See `legalize.py`'s module docstring
for exactly what backs each rule and its real caveats (in particular:
`gemm_transA_to_transpose`'s inserted `Transpose` is itself outside what
the scraped `Transpose` rule covers for a rank-2 tensor).

Run it **after** onnxsim's own simplify loop, not instead of it -- the same
order `scripts/axera/README.md` found necessary (its Audio8 decoder walk-
through gets the graph to float32 with fixed shapes via `onnxsim.simplify()`
*before* any legalize rule runs). `explicit_auto_pad` in particular needs the
input's spatial shape statically known, which is exactly what shape
inference/constant folding inside `simplify()` resolves; handing it a graph
`simplify()` hasn't already cleaned up just means more nodes it has to
decline for a shape it can't yet see.

```python
import onnx
import onnxsim
import legalize

model = onnx.load("model.onnx")
model, ok = onnxsim.simplify(model)  # the simplify loop, run to a fixed point
assert ok
applied = legalize.legalize(model)  # ... then legalize what it left explicit
onnx.save(model, "model.legalized.onnx")
```

Or from the command line: `python3 -m onnxsim in.onnx simplified.onnx` then
`legalize.py simplified.onnx out.onnx`. `tests/
test_axelera_legalize.py` checks each rule both structurally (against the
ONNX operator spec's own `auto_pad` formula) and numerically (`onnx.
reference.ReferenceEvaluator`, before vs. after), and cross-checks the
`evaluate_constraints()` verdict flips from `"violated"` to `"ok"` where the
rewrite is supposed to fully resolve a node -- none of that needs Docker,
a device, or the optional `axelera-rt`/`axelera-devkit` install.

### The same three rules, natively in onnxsim's own C++ core

`legalize.py` is a standalone script over a bare `onnx.ModelProto` -- useful
on its own, but Python-only and a separate pass over the graph. The same
three rewrites also exist as onnxsim C++ passes
(`onnxsim/passes/explicit_auto_pad.h`, `gemm_transa_to_transpose.h`,
`maxpool_rowmajor_when_indices_unused.h`), registered as opt-in
`PassType::Other` optimizers -- so any onnxsim binding (Python, C, Rust,
npm/WASM), not just this script, can run them, and they run *inside*
`simplify()`'s own fixed point rather than as a second pass after it. Those
core passes carry no Voyager/Axelera-specific knowledge at all -- they're
generic ONNX-legal rewrites for a *kind* of backend limitation
(explicit-padding-only, no `transA`, row-major-only `storage_order`); this
directory is the legalizer that knows Voyager needs all three, and why:

```python
model, ok = onnxsim.simplify(
    model,
    extra_optimizers=[
        "explicit_auto_pad",
        "gemm_transA_to_transpose",
        "maxpool_rowmajor_when_indices_unused",
    ],
)
```

or `onnxsim in.onnx out.onnx --enable-optimization explicit_auto_pad
--enable-optimization gemm_transA_to_transpose --enable-optimization
maxpool_rowmajor_when_indices_unused` from the CLI. See
`tests/test_explicit_auto_pad.py`, `tests/test_gemm_transa_to_transpose.py`
and `tests/test_maxpool_rowmajor_when_indices_unused.py` for their tests
(same rules, `onnxsim.simplify`'s own `check_n` doing the numeric-
equivalence check instead of a standalone `ReferenceEvaluator` round-trip).

This needs the pass actually compiled into the `onnxsim` in use -- true
from whatever release first ships it onward, or a local build off this
repo's own source (see the top-level `README.md`/`CMakeLists.txt`; it is
not a quick rebuild -- protobuf, ONNX and onnx-optimizer all compile from
scratch). When that isn't available, or a rebuild is simply unwanted, the
next section gets the same rules running inside `simplify()`'s fixed point
without one.

### Same rules, no rebuild: `custom_rewriter`

`onnxsim.simplify` already takes a `custom_rewriter` callable, run as an
extra stage inside its own simplification fixed point (interleaved with
shape inference/constant folding, same as a compiled-in pass). `legalize.
as_custom_rewriter()` adapts `legalize()` to that contract, so any
already-installed `onnxsim` -- a plain `pip install onnxsim`, nothing built
locally -- can run these three rules today:

```python
model, ok = onnxsim.simplify(
    model, custom_rewriter=legalize.as_custom_rewriter()
)
```

The tradeoff is per-round Python instead of a one-time-compiled C++ pass --
immaterial next to the cost of shape inference/constant folding on most
graphs, but worth knowing about. `custom_rewriter` and
`extra_optimizers`/`function_rewrite_rules` are not mutually exclusive with
each other in general, but passing this adapter *and* the native passes'
names in the same `simplify()` call would just run each rule twice for no
benefit -- pick one path per call.

## Regenerating `voyager_op_support_data.py`

The scraped data snapshot tracks whatever Voyager SDK checkout it was last
run against, not upstream automatically. To refresh it:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/axelera-ai-hub/voyager-sdk /tmp/voyager-sdk
python3 scrape_onnx_support_docs.py /tmp/voyager-sdk > voyager_op_support_data.py
```

The scraper cross-checks opsets 14-17 against each other and prints a
warning to stderr if a future Voyager SDK release makes them diverge (as of
this writing, support levels and constraints are identical across all four,
so only opset 17 -- the compiler's own recommended default -- is captured
in detail).

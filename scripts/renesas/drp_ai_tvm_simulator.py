"""A TVM-frontend-import-only estimate of whether an ONNX graph is even
loadable by Renesas RZ/V's DRP-AI TVM -- no compiler, no hardware, no
DRP-AI Translator involved. See `drp_ai_tvm_ops.py`'s module docstring for
what this data is (and, importantly, is not) sourced from.

Unlike `scripts/axelera/voyager_simulator.py`'s `partition()`, which
classifies each node independently (Voyager SDK's compiler falls back
per-node to host CPU for an undocumented op_type), TVM v0.8's ONNX frontend
does not partition at all: `GraphProto.from_onnx()` raises
`tvm.error.OpNotImplemented` for the *whole* import the moment any node's
op_type isn't in its convert map. So the meaningful question for a DRP-AI
TVM graph isn't "what fraction of nodes are eligible" -- it's binary: would
import succeed at all? `would_import_succeed()` and `coverage()` below
answer exactly that; `partition()` is kept for symmetry with the Axelera/
Axera simulators (and because knowing *how many* offending nodes/op_types
there are is still useful for a diagnostic message), but its per-node split
does not correspond to a CPU/accelerator split the way it does for Voyager.

**Nothing here says anything about DRP-AI hardware acceleration.** An
op_type this module calls "importable" only means TVM's frontend can turn
it into a Relay op; whether DRP-AI TVM's own BYOC pass then actually
accelerates that op on the DRP-AI engine, vs. running it on CPU, is decided
by the (non-public) DRP-AI Translator Manual and is entirely out of scope
here. Read `coverage() == "full"` as "onnxsim's output wouldn't immediately
break DRP-AI TVM's ONNX import step", not as "this graph runs well on
DRP-AI hardware".

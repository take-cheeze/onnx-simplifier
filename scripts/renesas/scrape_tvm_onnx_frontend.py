"""Regenerate `tvm_v08_onnx_frontend_op_support_data.py` from Apache TVM's
own ONNX importer source, at the exact TVM version Renesas's RZ/V DRP-AI TVM
(https://github.com/renesas-rz/rzv_drp-ai_tvm) vendors as its `tvm/` git
submodule (`.gitmodules`: `url = https://github.com/apache/tvm.git`,
`branch = v0.8`, as of the `main` branch checkout this was last run against).

Why this file exists instead of a docs scrape like `scripts/axelera/
scrape_onnx_support_docs.py`: neither Renesas AI toolchain publishes a
per-operator ONNX support matrix the way Axelera's Voyager SDK does.

- R-Car's Hybrid Compiler (HyCo) GitHub repo
  (github.com/renesas-rcar/renesas-rcar-HybridCompiler) is documentation-only
  -- no source, no op-support data, and explicitly gated: "No issues or
  merge requests allowed... contact Renesas Technical Support."
- RZ/V DRP-AI TVM is genuinely open source, but the actual per-operator
  *hardware acceleration* constraint list lives in the DRP-AI Translator
  Manual, Section 4.1 -- a document that isn't published in this (or any
  public) GitHub repo. `docs/Error_List.md` in the repo has known TVM error
  messages/workarounds, and `docs/Model_List.md` lists validated reference
  models with FPS numbers -- neither is a per-op support table.

What *is* public and exact, though, is the ONNX importer TVM itself ships:
`python/tvm/relay/frontend/onnx.py`'s `_get_convert_map()` -- a literal
Python dict whose keys are every ONNX `op_type` TVM's Relay frontend knows
how to convert at all ("Constant" included -- it's an ordinary entry in
this dict, not a separate case; an earlier version of this docstring
wrongly claimed `GraphProto.from_onnx()` special-cased it outside the
dict, based on misreading that function's admission check, whose
`op_name != "Constant"` clause is dead code precisely *because* "Constant"
is already in `convert_map` -- confirmed by cross-checking this scraped
data against the live, installed package in
`tests/test_renesas_drp_ai_tvm_real_frontend.py`). `GraphProto.from_onnx()`
(same file) checks every graph node's `op_type` against this dict before
converting anything, and raises `tvm.error.OpNotImplemented` for the
*whole* import if any node's op_type is missing -- not a per-node CPU
fallback, unlike Voyager SDK's AIPU/host partitioning. That exact gate is
what this data (and `drp_ai_tvm_simulator.py`, built on it) reproduces.

**This says nothing about DRP-AI hardware acceleration itself.** An op_type
in this dict just means TVM's frontend can turn it into a Relay op -- DRP-AI
TVM's own BYOC pass then decides, per the undocumented Translator Manual,
which of those Relay ops actually run on the DRP-AI accelerator vs. fall
back to CPU. See `drp_ai_tvm_ops.py` and `drp_ai_tvm_simulator.py`'s module
docstrings for exactly what is and isn't licensed to conclude from this.

Usage: clone apache/tvm at the branch/tag DRP-AI TVM's `.gitmodules` pins
(currently `v0.8`) next to this checkout (or anywhere), then:

    git clone --branch v0.8 https://github.com/apache/tvm.git /tmp/tvm-v0.8
    python3 scrape_tvm_onnx_frontend.py /tmp/tvm-v0.8 \
        > tvm_v08_onnx_frontend_op_support_data.py

To re-check which TVM version current DRP-AI TVM actually pins (it may move
past v0.8 in a future Renesas release), check
`https://github.com/renesas-rz/rzv_drp-ai_tvm/blob/main/.gitmodules`'s
`[submodule "tvm"]` stanza before re-running this against a different tag.

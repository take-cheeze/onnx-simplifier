"""Heuristics for Axera's Pulsar2/AXCL NPU compiler stack, without a real compiler.

Axera's `pulsar2 build` toolchain (the compiler behind AXCL / `.axmodel` for
the AX6xx/AX8xx NPU line) is a Docker-only download with no PyPI package and
no ONNX Runtime execution provider -- unlike the Qualcomm QNN
(`scripts/qualcomm`), Intel OpenVINO (`scripts/intel`), and AMD MIGraphX
(`scripts/amd`) stacks, there is no way to actually invoke it here to measure
real op coverage. See `../../../junk/axcl-axmodel-onnxsim-notes.md` (the
handoff notes this harness is based on) for the fuller picture.

**Update, verified against a real AX650N + a real compiled `.axmodel`
(`AXERA-TECH/YOLOv8`'s `AX650/yolov8n_640x640_npu1.axmodel`):** the notes'
§4 guess that an embedded NPU subgraph would show up as a node with a
*non-standard ONNX `domain`* turned out to be **wrong**. The real file has
exactly one node, `op_type="neu mode"` in the plain default domain (`""`),
whose declared graph input is only the model's real input (`images`) -- the
NPU weight/command blobs are ordinary UINT8 `graph.initializer` tensors
(`npu_params`, `<node_name>_b<N>_neu`) that are **not** referenced as a node
input at all. Instead, the node's `npu_graph_info` attribute is a JSON string
naming them by key (`const_data_key`, `neu_key`); a sibling `outputs_info`
attribute JSON-describes the outputs' dtype/shape. See `AXERA_NPU_OP_TYPE`,
`referenced_const_data_keys()` and `missing_npu_data()` below, and
`inspect_axmodel.py`, which is what produced this.

For what's actually *inside* the `<neu_key>`-named blob (a real, confirmed
FlatBuffers container -- hand-decoded root table + vtable, matching the
public spec -- wrapping a tensor I/O offset table around an opaque,
proprietary NPU instruction stream), plus what a real `--compiler.npu_perf`
trace.json reveals about the AX650's actual multi-engine execution model
(5 named parallel engines, on-chip-vs-DRAM memory regions, ONNX-op-to-NPU-
primitive lowering), see README.md's "Digging into a compiled `.axmodel`'s
`neu mode` node" section.

This out-of-band reference is exactly the fragility §4(a) of the handoff
notes worried about, and it is not hypothetical: `missing_npu_data()` exists
because running plain `onnxsim.simplify()` on this real file reproducibly
**strips `npu_params`/`npu_dyn_params`/`*_neu` from the output** -- both
onnxsim's own constant-folding cleanup and onnx-optimizer's
`eliminate_unused_initializer`/`eliminate_deadend` passes independently treat
them as dead, since neither is a declared node *input* -- shrinking the file
from 3.4MB to 1.7KB. The result fails to even load via `axcl_run_model` on
the real device ("Create model handle failed").

**There is no working flag-only avoidance**, confirmed by exhausting the
combinations: `skip_constant_folding=True` alone still strips them (the
onnx-optimizer passes get them); `skipped_optimizers=["eliminate_unused_
initializer", "eliminate_deadend"]` alone still strips them (constant folding
gets them); doing *both* keeps the 3 initializers byte-identical, but the
result *still* fails to load, because onnxsim's shape-inference/graph-rebuild
also unconditionally drops the `graph.value_info` entries describing those
tensors (10 -> 0, even with `skip_shape_inference=True`) and Axera's runtime
needs those too. In short: as of this onnxsim version, **feeding it an
already-compiled `.axmodel` is not safe with any public `simplify()`
parameter combination** -- see `has_out_of_band_npu_data()` below, meant to
be checked *before* calling `simplify()` at all, and `worker.py`/`missing_
npu_data()` to catch it *after* if that guard is skipped.

For everything Pulsar2 itself hasn't confirmed (the general NPU-vs-CPU op
split, since only one node's contents were ever visible in this one file),
this module still falls back to the safer complement it started with: op
types extremely unlikely to be NPU-schedulable on *any* fixed-function NPU
toolchain (control flow, sequence/optional types, string ops, ops with
data-dependent output shape), plus the original (now known to be
Axera-specific-case-of, not general-case) non-standard-`domain` check, kept
as a heuristic for vendor blobs that don't follow Axera's exact convention.
Presence of one of these is a strong signal the graph (or region of it) will
not run on Pulsar2's NPU as-is; *absence* is not proof the rest is
NPU-schedulable, only that this harness found no known blocker.

**Update: the real NPU op-support list is no longer an open question.**
Axera publishes it -- `AX650_SUPPORTED_OPS` below is the 92 op names scraped
from Pulsar2 V7.0's docs (`appendix/op_support_list_ax650.html`), which also
states **the whole model must be ONNX opset >= 11** (`AX650_MIN_OPSET`).
`unsupported_on_ax650()` flags op types outside that list.

This was exercised end-to-end with the real `pulsar2:6.0-lite` Docker
toolchain + a real AX650N, converting two real `onnxmodelzoo` models:

- `resnet18d_Opset18` (opset 18, all ops in `AX650_SUPPORTED_OPS`): both the
  original ONNX and its onnxsim-simplified twin compiled to a single NPU
  subgraph with **identical compiler-reported `max_cycle`
  (1,318,764)**, and running both `.axmodel`s on the real device with the
  same input produced **bit-identical output** (`np.array_equal` `True`,
  max abs diff `0.0`) -- the strongest evidence so far that onnxsim's
  approach-(b) simplification (§4(b) of the handoff notes) is safe for
  Pulsar2.
- `googlenet-6` (opset 9, uses `LRN` -- not in `AX650_SUPPORTED_OPS`):
  `pulsar2 build` did **not** gracefully fall LRN back to CPU the way the
  handoff notes' §2 description of mixed CPU/NPU graphs implied it might --
  it hard-failed the whole build at the frontend parse stage with
  `KeyError('dont support LRN opr in AXOPS/ONNXOPS/CUSTOM_OPS')` before any
  CPU/NPU partitioning happened. So an op outside `AX650_SUPPORTED_OPS` is
  not just "less NPU-friendly," it can make `pulsar2 build` refuse the model
  outright -- confirmed for `LRN`, not verified for every other absent op.

**Update: LLMs, resolving the handoff notes' §3.** `pulsar2 build` (this
module's focus so far) is not how Axera compiles LLMs at all -- that's a
completely separate subcommand, `pulsar2 llm_build` (the real `pulsar2:
6.0-lite` toolchain's name; Pulsar2's own newer docs describe a
`llm_build2` with a slightly different flag set, e.g.
`--max_context`/`--prefill_step_size` instead of `--kv_cache_len` -- v6.0
only has `llm_build`). Confirmed by actually running it, on a real
`Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B` checkpoint through the real toolchain, then on the real
AX650N (see `pulsar2_docker.llm_build()`'s docstring for the full
command/timing):

- **`--input_path` is a raw HuggingFace checkpoint directory**
  (`*.safetensors`/`pytorch_model.bin` + `config.json`) -- there is no ONNX
  step anywhere in this pipeline. The public `ax-llm-build` project Pulsar2's
  docs point to for this workflow (github.com/AXERA-TECH/ax-llm-build)
  contains no model-tracing/export code at all, only per-architecture config
  JSONs and small helper scripts around the actual (closed-source)
  `pulsar2 llm_build` call. **onnxsim has no direct integration point in
  this ingestion path** -- there is no ONNX graph for it to simplify or
  quantize before Pulsar2 ever sees the model. `-w`/`--weight_type` (default
  `s8`) is Pulsar2's *own* built-in weight quantization, entirely separate
  from `pulsar2_quantizer.py`.
- Output is **one compiled `.axmodel` per transformer layer** (28 for this
  0.6B model) plus one `_post.axmodel` (the LM head) -- confirming the
  handoff notes' guess that LLMs are "a directory of small, structurally
  similar single-block graphs," not one big graph.
- Each per-layer file has **two** `AXERA_NPU_OP_TYPE` nodes, not one: a
  decode subgraph (batch-1 shapes) and a prefill subgraph
  (`prefill_len`-batch shapes), both sharing one `npu_params` initializer.
  Both also carry explicit `K_cache`/`V_cache` graph inputs *and*
  `K_cache_out`/`V_cache_out` outputs -- the KV cache is ordinary graph
  tensors the host runtime persists between calls, not something opaque
  inside the compiled blob. `npu_subgraph_nodes()`/`has_out_of_band_npu_data()`/
  `missing_npu_data()` below already handle multiple NPU nodes per graph
  correctly with no changes needed -- verified: `onnxsim.simplify()`
  corrupts a real per-layer `.axmodel` the same way as the CNN case (3
  initializers -> 0).
- Both a per-layer file and the post model ran successfully on the real
  AX650N via `axcl_run_model` (~1.5ms and ~9ms respectively).

**Update: systematic single-node-per-op coverage sweep, 29% -> 99%
(91/92).** A single-node-per-op battery run against a real
`pulsar2:6.0-lite` build took confirmed coverage of `AX650_SUPPORTED_OPS`
from 27/92 to 91/92. Most confirmed working; a real, generalizable gotcha
surfaced along the way (an ONNX attribute left unset to take its schema
default -- e.g. `Elu.alpha`, `LeakyRelu.alpha`, `TopK.largest`/`sorted` --
is read as `None` by Pulsar2's frontend and crashes with a confusing
internal error, not a graceful fallback; setting the same value explicitly
fixes it). Most importantly for this module: **7 listed ops confirmed to
hard-fail despite being in `AX650_SUPPORTED_OPS`, plus 10 unlisted ops
confirmed to fail at the same frontend stages** -- see
`AX650_CONFIRMED_BROKEN_OPS` and `confirmed_broken_on_ax650()` below, now
wired into `pulsar2_backend.ax650_build_risks()` and
`pulsar2_simulator.partition()` so both flag these correctly instead of
treating "in AX650_SUPPORTED_OPS" as sufficient. See README.md's
"Systematic op coverage: from 29% to 99% of AX650_SUPPORTED_OPS" section for
the full sweep.

"""Build a resnet18-shaped training-step graph with the weight update *in
the graph*, for a resident runner to keep entirely device-side.

`finetune.py`'s loop treats a compiled training step as a pure function:
feed weights and a batch, get back a gradient, and do `w -= lr * grad` in
host numpy. That means every trainable weight crosses the host<->device
boundary twice a step (once as input, once as the returned gradient) for no
reason but that the update lives off-device -- 42.9 MB of the resnet18
step's 42.9 MB moved is exactly this, measured in
`docs/axera-on-device-training-handoff.md`.

This module builds a different graph for the same step: each trainable
weight is a **state** tensor (`onnxsim.qat_graph.StepGraph`'s sense) that is
both an input and an output, with `w_next = w - lr * grad` computed by
ordinary `Mul`/`Sub` nodes inside the graph itself (plain SGD, no momentum --
matching `finetune.train()`'s own host update exactly, so the two are
directly comparable). A resident runner
(`scripts/axera/tools/resident_runner.c`) can then bind each state output
back to its own input's device buffer between `Execute()` calls and never
send the weight across the host boundary at all; only the batch (`x`, `y`)
goes in and the scalar loss comes out.

Pipeline, and why the order matters:

1. Append a scalar loss to the forward model (`Sub`/`Mul`/`ReduceMean`, with
   explicit `axes` -- see `legalize.avgpool_ceil_to_floor`'s and
   `global_pool_to_reduce`'s own docstrings for the vendor bug this dodges).
2. Legalize *forward*-graph blockers that are differentiability blockers,
   not just Pulsar2-compile-time ones: `avgpool_ceil_to_floor`,
   `flatten_to_reshape`, `global_pool_to_reduce`. `onnxsim.graph_grad` has no
   rule for `Flatten`/`GlobalAveragePool` and declines `ceil_mode=1`
   outright, so these three must run *before* `build_backward`, not after
   (unlike the rest of `legalize.TRAINING_RULES`, which only needs to run on
   the finished step graph).
3. `onnxsim.graph_grad.build_backward()` differentiates the (now legal)
   forward+loss graph against the chosen trainable weights.
4. Plain SGD, in-graph: `step = lr * grad; w_next = w - step` per weight,
   via `onnxsim.qat_graph.GraphBuilder.mul`/`.sub` directly -- not
   `qat_graph.sgd_momentum_update`, which always carries a momentum buffer
   as extra state; this is the zero-momentum case `finetune.py`'s host loop
   already implements, so there is nothing to gain from carrying one.
5. `onnxsim.qat_graph.make_step_graph()` wraps it into a `StepGraph` and
   simplifies with the same skip list `docs/axera-on-device-training-
   handoff.md`'s "Simplify the gradient graph" section describes
   (`fuse_matmul_add_bias_into_gemm`/`fuse_transpose_into_gemm` -- a training
   graph's whole point is a *live* weight, and both fusions would rebuild
   exactly the `Gemm`/transpose-into-`Gemm` shape this graph exists to
   avoid).
6. The remaining `legalize.TRAINING_RULES` (`inline_local_functions`,
   `avgpool_ceil_to_floor` again for any pool the update graph itself
   introduced, `neg_to_mul`, `rank0_to_rank1`, `gemm_to_matmul`,
   `act_weight_conv_to_matmul`) make the *step* graph -- backward pass and
   update included -- something `pulsar2 build` will actually lower.
7. One more `onnxsim.simplify()` pass, same skip list: `act_weight_conv_to_
   matmul`'s per-tap expansion multiplies node count, and consecutive taps
   slicing the same tensors collapse under common-subexpression elimination
   -- worth doing after legalization, not only before it (same finding the
   handoff's own "Simplify the gradient graph" section records).

One graph-construction quirk worth naming: `qat_graph.make_step_graph`
declares every scalar input (here, just `lr`) at rank 0. Pulsar2's
calibration step concatenates each input across calibration samples, and a
rank-0 tensor cannot be concatenated -- the same failure
`legalize.rank0_to_rank1` exists to fix for a rank-0 *output* (the loss).
There is no equivalent rule for a rank-0 *input*, so this module reshapes
`lr` to `[1]` directly after `make_step_graph` returns; broadcasting a `[1]`
scalar against every weight's `Mul` is identical arithmetic.

See `tests/test_build_resident_train_step.py` for a from-scratch synthetic
model exercising this whole pipeline without resnet18 or real hardware, and
`docs/axera-on-device-training-handoff.md` for the measured speed this
bought on a real AX650N.

    """Rewrites each `Conv` node whose weight is in `params` from `Conv(x,
    w)` into the *same* im2col-as-gather identity `onnxsim.graph_grad`'s own
    `_grad_conv` already uses internally for this op's backward -- one
    `Gather`/`Mul`(mask)/`MatMul`, no `Transpose` of the weight at all.

    Why this exists, and why `legalize.act_weight_conv_to_matmul` is not
    enough: this weight is about to become **state** -- an input *and* an
    output of a graph run repeatedly by a resident runner that keeps state
    device-side between calls (see this module's docstring). Left as a plain
    `Conv(x, w)`, `act_weight_conv_to_matmul` legalizes it by transposing `w`
    from `[Cout, Cin, k...]` into `[k..., Cin, Cout]` *inside the compiled
    graph* -- correct for a one-shot inference graph, but on a real AX650N
    that transpose is recomputed from scratch on every `Execute()` call even
    though the weight barely changes step to step: measured (real hardware,
    `pulsar2 build --compiler.npu_perf`) at 89.6% of the whole step's
    `AxTranspose` cost and 13.3% of total NPU cycles, entirely from the two
    512-channel trainable convs (`docs/axera-on-device-training-
    handoff.md`'s "AxTranspose/AxSlice glue" section).

    An earlier version tried moving that transpose to build time by keeping
    state in the transposed layout; a finite-difference check confirmed the
    update numerics. At that time, backward construction also lacked the
    `Pad`/`Slice`/`Concat` rules needed by `act_weight_conv_to_matmul`.
    Static Python VJPs for those generated patterns now exist, so that
    autodiff blocker is lifted. Pre-transposed state still requires expanding
    the Conv before `build_backward` and changing state serialization to
    permute weights on input/output; this builder does neither. For the
    common ungrouped 1-D/2-D Conv case, the current fix is to **avoid needing
    a weight transpose in the first place**: `_grad_conv`'s own docstring
    spells out the identity --

        col[c, t, o] = X[c, position(o, t)]      (im2col: one gather)
        Y[m, o]      = sum_{c, t} W[m, c, t] * col[c, t, o]

    -- where "W reshaped to `[M, C*K]`" is `w.reshape(Cout, -1)`, a plain
    C-order reshape of the *original* `[Cout, Cin, k...]` layout with no
    data movement at all, because `Cin` is already `W`'s second axis and
    `k...` are already trailing -- unlike `act_weight_conv_to_matmul`'s
    `[k..., Cin, Cout]`, which moves `Cout` from first to last. Building the
    forward pass with this identity (reusing `graph_grad`'s own
    `_conv_geometry`/`_im2col_indices` so the index/mask tables are exactly
    the ones `_grad_conv` would derive for the same node) means: no weight
    transpose ever appears, `Gather`/`Mul`/`MatMul`/`Reshape` are all
    builtin-differentiable so `build_backward` needs no custom gradient
    registration either, and the gradient it produces is already in `w`'s
    original, unchanged shape -- so **state stays exactly the shape it
    always was**, nothing above this function (`params`, `state`,
    `shapes[p]`) changes at all. Identical convolution geometries share the
    same immutable index and mask initializers, avoiding duplicate large
    constants and repeated index-table construction in multi-block training
    graphs.

    A `Conv` this function declines (see `_conv_geometry`'s own refusals:
    not 1-D/2-D, `auto_pad`, a geometry that does not reproduce its declared
    output shape, ...; grouped convs are declined here directly, since the
    identity above assumes `group=1`) is left untouched and still caught by
    `act_weight_conv_to_matmul` later in `_POST_BACKWARD_RULES` -- this
    function is an optimization for the common case (an ungrouped 1-D/2-D
    conv, which is every trainable conv resnet18 has), not a superset of
    that rule's coverage.

    index vector -- `onnxsim.qat_graph.GraphBuilder.gather_rows`'s pattern
    (see its own docstring) applied to this pipeline for the first time.

    `flatten` (default `True`) stores and gathers every rank>=3 array as a
    flat `[N, prod(shape[1:])]` initializer, `Reshape`-ing each gathered row
    back to its real shape (`[batch, *shape[1:]]`) immediately afterward,
    rather than gathering the native `[N, C, H, W]` shape directly. This is
    the workaround `docs/axera-on-device-training-handoff.md`'s "Trading
    free memory for throughput" section names and confirms fixes a real
    Pulsar2 NPU-backend gap: `Gather` over a 4D, conv-activation-shaped
    resident tensor fails identically in Pulsar2's backend compiler
    regardless of dataset size, while the same `Gather` over a flat 2D
    tensor (plus an ordinary, separately-supported `Reshape`) compiles and
    runs. Pass `flatten=False` to get the old, pre-workaround behavior (e.g.
    to reproduce that failure, or for a rank<=2 dataset where flattening is
    a no-op anyway).

    Every training step measured for this pipeline so far re-uploads `x`/`y`
    fresh every call (`resident_runner.c`'s main loop:
    `axclrtMemcpy(in_bufs[x_in], hx, ..., AXCL_MEMCPY_HOST_TO_DEVICE)`, every
    iteration) even though the trainable weights are already kept resident.
    This is a different, complementary residency: `data[name]`'s full
    `[N, ...]` array becomes a plain graph **initializer** -- baked into the
    compiled `.axmodel` and resident on-device from load, the same way a
    frozen conv weight already is, not merely "uploaded once" the way
    `qat_graph`'s own `bind_loop` keeps a bound tensor resident for an
    onnxruntime session. What crosses the host boundary each step is
    `index_name`, a rank-1 `int64` of length `batch` (`batch` read from
    `data[name]`'s *current* declared input shape, i.e. call this after
    `set_batch`, not before) -- `qat_graph.minibatch_indices` already
    generates the exact index stream this expects.

    All of `data`'s tensors are gathered by the *same* `index_name` -- they
    must therefore share row count `N` along axis 0 (true for any `x`/`y`
    pair drawn from one dataset; not checked here beyond the `Gather`'s own
    shape inference catching a mismatch).

    Call this on the forward+loss model, before `build_resident_step`: the
    replaced inputs must already be gone by the time `build_resident_step`
    walks `model.graph.input` to decide the step graph's own per-step
    constants, and `graph_grad.build_backward` needs the inserted `Gather`
    nodes present in the graph it walks (Gather already has a rule --
    `graph_grad._grad_gather`, exercised elsewhere in this pipeline for
    conv-as-matmul taps -- so no new gradient machinery is needed; nothing
    downstream ever asks for a gradient *of* the dataset or the index, since
    neither is in `build_resident_step`'s `params`).

"""Emit an `.axmodel`'s weight table without a compiler, by learning its encoding.

The AX650N stores a convolution's weights as **bit planes**: a byte of
`npu_params` is a mixture of single bits taken from several different weight
codes, at offsets that this repository's README recovers rule by rule -- gaps
of 36, strides of 144, per-tap padding, polyphase reversal for transposes, and
a per-output-channel cost that is charged per *bit* rather than per row. Those
rules were worth deriving because they explain the format. They are a poor
foundation for an emitter, because each new shape or dtype adds another.

This module skips the rules. Every bit of the table is either constant for a
given shape, or *equal to one specific bit of one specific weight code* -- the
encoding is a bit permutation, whatever the arithmetic behind it. So compile
the same shape `k` times with different weights, and read the permutation off
directly: each table bit's column of `k` observed values is a signature, and
the code bit carrying the same signature is the one it came from.

`k` random builds give `8k` independent sample bits per code, and naming one
code bit out of `Cout*Cin*K*8` needs about 15, so four builds already make a
wrong match a ~1e-5 event and six leave no doubt. That is the entire method,
and it does not care which of the seven layouts the shape happens to use.

What it buys: one set of reference builds per *shape*, after which any weights
at that shape can be written without Pulsar2 -- which is what
`README.md`'s "An emitter for the llm_build path" already showed for the LLM
path by hand, generalised and made shape-agnostic.

Usage::

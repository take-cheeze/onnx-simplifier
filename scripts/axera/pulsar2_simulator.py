"""An axmodel *simulator*: NPU/CPU partition + numeric estimate, no Docker/device.

Shaped like the sibling `*_backend.py` modules (`coverage()`, `run_with_cpu()`,
a run-the-other-path function, `compare()`), but where those wrap a *real*
execution provider, this wraps two things that only need `onnx` + `onnxruntime`:

1. **Partitioning**, from `pulsar2_ops.AX650_SUPPORTED_OPS` -- the real AX650
   NPU operator-coverage list read out of Pulsar2's own docs and confirmed
   against real hardware (see `pulsar2_ops.py`'s docstring: it correctly
   predicted a real `resnet18d_Opset18` build succeeding fully-on-NPU and a
   real `googlenet-6` build hard-failing on `LRN`). `partition()` classifies
   every node the same way and reports what fraction would run on NPU.
2. **Numeric estimation**, via `pulsar2_quantizer.quantize_like_pulsar2()`
   run through onnxruntime's CPU EP -- an approximation of what the
   INT8-quantized NPU path would produce, since there is no real EP for
   Pulsar2 to run through (see `pulsar2_ops.py`'s docstring for why).

**This is an estimate, not an emulator** -- two things it does NOT do:

- It does not reproduce Pulsar2's actual quantized IR (`AxQuantizedConv` and
  friends, confirmed proprietary and non-ONNX-Runtime-executable -- see
  `pulsar2_quantizer.py`) or its exact fusion/rounding behavior.
- Partitioning here is purely per-node op-type membership in
  `AX650_SUPPORTED_OPS` (minus `AX650_CONFIRMED_BROKEN_OPS`, see below); it
  does not model attribute-level limits (e.g. Conv's `auto_pad` must be
  `NOTSET`) or how Pulsar2 actually groups/merges eligible nodes into
  subgraphs.

**Update, from the 91/92-op real-hardware coverage sweep:** 7 ops listed in
`AX650_SUPPORTED_OPS` (`ConvTranspose`, `Xor`, `Squeeze`, `LpNormalization`,
`RotaryEmbedding`, `Swish`, `InverseSigmoid`) are confirmed via real
`pulsar2 build` to hard-fail anyway -- see
`pulsar2_ops.AX650_CONFIRMED_BROKEN_OPS`. `partition()` now places these on
the CPU side (tracked in `Partition.confirmed_broken_op_types`) instead of
treating docs-list membership alone as NPU-eligible.

Use it to get a fast first read (does this graph look NPU-friendly? is
onnxsim's simplification likely to change that? roughly how much does INT8
hurt this model's outputs?) before spending time on `pulsar2 build` --
always confirm anything that matters on the real toolchain and hardware.

**Validated against real hardware** (`resnet18d_Opset18`, real AX650N, same
input image both times): `coverage()` correctly reported "full" (matching
the real build's single fused NPU subgraph) and "partial" with
`cpu_op_types={"LRN": 2, "Dropout": 1}` for `googlenet-6` (matching its real
hard build failure on `LRN`). For `simulate()`'s numeric side: cosine
similarity between this simulator's INT8 output (via `onnxsim.
quantize_static`, see `pulsar2_quantizer.py`) and the real device's actual
INT8 output was **0.938**, close to fp32-vs-real's own **0.949** -- i.e. this
simulator's quantization noise is roughly the same *magnitude* as Pulsar2's
real quantization noise, relative to the fp32 baseline. It is **not**
rank-accurate, though: top-5 class rankings did not match between fp32, this
simulator, and the real device on that (random-noise, no real semantic
content) test input -- small logit perturbations from any INT8 path are
enough to reorder closely-spaced logits. Treat `simulate()`'s output as "is
the quantization noise roughly sane," not "will this be the same top-1
prediction as real hardware."

"""Static Pulsar2 (Axera AXCL NPU) coverage check -- no compiler, no device.

Unlike `scripts/qualcomm/qnn_backend.py`, `scripts/intel/openvino_backend.py`
and `scripts/amd/migraphx_backend.py`, this module wraps no real compiler:
Pulsar2 has no pip package and no ONNX Runtime execution provider to invoke,
so there is nothing to install or emulate here (see `pulsar2_ops.py`'s
docstring for why). ``PULSAR2_AVAILABLE`` is always True and this always runs
on a plain CPU host with only ``onnx`` installed -- it exists for interface
symmetry with the sibling EP backends, not because availability can vary.

What this *can* do without a real compiler: flag when onnxsim turns a graph
region that had no known Pulsar2-NPU blocker into one that does (see
`pulsar2_ops.blocking_ops`). That is the concrete risk §4(b) of the handoff
notes calls out -- a simplification could fold something into a form the NPU
partitioner then refuses, silently pushing more of the graph onto Pulsar2's
CPU fallback path.

It can also catch something worse, confirmed against a real AX650N and a
real compiled `.axmodel`: `stripped_npu_data()` detects when onnxsim has
dropped a `neu mode` node's NPU weight/command blob because Axera references
it only by name inside a JSON attribute, not as a declared graph input (see
`pulsar2_ops.missing_npu_data`). That isn't a coverage regression, it's
outright file corruption -- the resulting `.axmodel` fails to even load, and
no combination of `simplify()`'s public parameters was found to avoid it
(see `pulsar2_ops.has_out_of_band_npu_data`, meant to be checked *before*
calling `simplify()` at all -- right now the only confirmed-safe answer for a
model that already has NPU subgraph nodes is not to run it through onnxsim).

`ax650_build_risks()` uses Axera's own published AX650 op list plus a real
`pulsar2:6.0-lite` + AX650N run to flag likely hard build failures ahead of
time (see `pulsar2_ops.py`'s docstring for the real `resnet18d`/`googlenet-6`
conversions this is based on).

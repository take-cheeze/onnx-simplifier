"""Emit NPU mcode for tinygrad-traced graphs.

Pipeline: a tinygrad ``Tensor`` graph is traced to its UOp pattern,
matched by one of the ``trace_*`` functions below, and (for Neg so far)
emitted as an mcode stream assembled from a reference Pulsar2 build with
caller-chosen output scales (found by value as float32 words -- Neg
carries its output scale as four stride-7 copies).

``trace_neg``/``trace_add``/``trace_mul`` match single- or two-node UOp
patterns (unary negation lowers to ``MUL(x, CONST(-1.0))``; a genuine
two-tensor add or multiply to ``ADD(a, b)``/``MUL(a, b)`` with neither
operand a ``CONST`` -- the two ``Ops.MUL`` matchers are mutually
exclusive by that const check). ``trace_relu``/``trace_sigmoid`` match
deeper compound patterns tinygrad lowers these ops to, since neither has
a dedicated UOp: Relu is ``WHERE(CMPLT(CONST(0.0), x), x, CONST(0.0))``
(a compare-and-select, with an operand-*identity* check -- not just
shape/dtype equality -- that the ``x`` compared against 0 is the same
UOp used as the true branch), and Sigmoid is
``RECIPROCAL(ADD(CONST(1.0), EXP2(MUL(x, CONST(-log2(e))))))`` (the
standard ``e^-x = 2^(-x*log2(e))`` rewrite, checked by exact float
equality against ``-math.log2(math.e)``). Every pattern here was
confirmed by direct UOp inspection against a real tinygrad install, not
assumed from tinygrad's Python source -- these lowerings can and do
change across tinygrad versions.

The Add matcher and a corresponding Sub scale patcher can transplant the
three confirmed output-scale fields in existing templates, while requiring
the graph shape and input quantization to remain the same. Neg has its own
scale patcher; the other matchers still describe graphs without claiming
that their mcode can be synthesized. See each function's docstring for the
exact boundary.

``patch_site_a`` and ``patch_matmul_a_scale`` (2026-09) generalize the
site-A idea beyond Mul, to Gemm/Conv and MatMul's own operands -- the
first mcode *generation* work built directly on this project's later,
much larger decode effort (site A's cross-op generalization, and
MatMul's exact short/full-form switching rule). See
tests/test_axera_sitea_generator.py for what's verified (byte-exact
against real target builds, both directions of MatMul's same-form
case) and, just as importantly, what's refused and why: a form-crossing
MatMul ``A`` edit is not a local patch -- a controlled build pair
(same ``B`` seed, same table order) shows it reflows 201 bytes across
the stream, not just the quad's own footprint. That refusal is the
general shape of why most of this project's later shape-derived
decode findings (Gemm's ``K*M-1`` field, Conv's dilation/orientation
fields) are *understood* but not yet *generatable*: knowing a field's
value is not the same as knowing it's safe to write in place.

``patch_mul_scales`` extends the same reference-patch idea to two-input
Mul streams' input side (sites A/C/B -- see
tests/test_axera_mcode_reciprocal.py for the field map): given the
reference build's recorded scales and the target scales, it rewrites the
input reciprocal and requant slots by value, verifying each family forms
its exact stride run. ``patch_mul_output_quad`` does the same for the
output-side scale quad (``03 <f32(z_scale)> 81 <tag2>`` x4 stride 7--
``tag2`` varies build to build, unlike the always-``81`` byte before it;
not patched, not relied on). ``patch_mul_zp_x`` patches x's zero point,
but *only* when the reference build happens to use the one zero-point
form this project has actually decoded (see below) -- it raises rather
than silently doing nothing when it doesn't apply, since whether it
applies is not predictable in advance. ``patch_conv_zp_x`` is the same
patch for Conv (the literal unit was confirmed identical across ops);
see its own docstring for a caveat ``patch_mul_zp_x`` does not carry --
patching this unit alone was checked against a real second Conv build
with x_scale held bit-identical and did *not* reproduce that build's
mcode elsewhere in the stream (~20 bytes beyond the unit and the
shape's own noise floor also move with zp_x), unlike the scale-family
patches below, which a real hardware test confirmed reproduce a
rebuild bit-exactly.

What none of this touches: the S-unit programs themselves (magnitude-
adaptive shape, unmodeled ISA), the manifest string table (tensor-name
order varies build to build), y's zero point (no literal encoding found
for it at all, decoded or not), z's own zero point (see the hardware
result below -- it did not need patching, at least once), or x's zero
point when the reference build doesn't use the literal form -- which is
the common case, not an edge case (confirmed non-predictable from zp_x's
value at any magnitude, see ``TestZpXLiteralByteWhenPresent`` in the
test file). Because of that last point, and because z_scale changing
generally moves far more of the stream than the five families patched
here (A, B, C, the output quad, zp_x -- z's own calibration range shifts
the S-unit programs' internal
constants throughout, not just the named slots -- confirmed by diffing
same-shape builds at different z scales: over a thousand bytes move),
**full-stream equality after patching is not a goal and should not be
expected**; what is verified is that each named family lands on the
target build's own bytes for that family.

Status (2026-09-16): scale, output-quad and (when present) zp_x words
are mapped, verified offline (round-trip exactly, pass ``mcode.check``),
and confirmed twice on real AX650N hardware
(tests/test_axera_mul_emit_hardware.py): patching a reference build's
scales + output quad + zp_x (17 bytes total, in that one build pair)
reproduced a real rebuild's device output *bit-exactly*, not just within
quantization noise, and neither zp_y nor zp_z needed touching for that
result to hold. This supersedes an earlier note here about the emitted
stream running ~0.19-vs-0.006 against ORT -- that check pre-dated the
output-quad and zp_x work and used a different code path (``emit_neg``,
not the Mul patch functions); it has not been repeated against these.

**Practical recommendation, also hardware-confirmed**: if the calibration
data can be chosen (as opposed to given), keep it non-negative for both
inputs -- MinMax clipping then guarantees zp_x = zp_y = 0 (see
``TestSiteBFormSelectorIsZpX`` in the test file), which sidesteps
``patch_mul_zp_x`` and its "does this build even use the literal form"
uncertainty entirely: only ``patch_mul_scales`` + ``patch_mul_output_quad``
are needed, and that combination also reproduces a real rebuild
bit-exactly (second test in the hardware file). Two data points, not a
general proof -- see the hardware test file's own docstring for exactly
what is and isn't covered. tinygrad itself is an optional, lazily-imported
dependency. ``emit_add`` also loads ``mcode.py`` lazily for instruction
boundary decoding, so that operation also requires ``onnx`` when called;
``minmax_scale`` lazily uses NumPy.

    noise floor also move with zp_x alone, at offsets this project has
    not decoded. Callers should not expect (and this function does not
    claim) that patching this unit alone reproduces a real rebuild
    bit-exactly, the way Mul's *scale*-family patches were confirmed to
    on real hardware (``tests/test_axera_mul_emit_hardware.py``) --
    zp_x's own patch has not had, and does not currently pass, that same
    bar. See ``tests/test_axera_conv_zpx_generator.py`` for the exact
    build pair and byte counts this was checked against.

    **A third caveat, decoded (not merely observed) 2026-09-18: for
    ``Conv(dilation=3, pad=3, cin=4, cout=4, insz=16)``-shaped inputs
    specifically, the ``<zp_x>`` byte this function writes IS the same
    register as ``reg=60``, part of Conv's own already-decoded 28-byte
    "binary path switch" (``tests/test_axera_conv_reg60_mechanism.py``).**
    Confirmed structurally across all 52 already-committed fixtures of
    that exact shape (this project's own PR #1636 test file, zero
    exceptions): the 6-byte literal unit this function searches for
    is the complete on-the-wire encoding of an ``S``-kind, ``reg=54``,
    ``tag=131`` record, and ``reg=54`` is independently already known to
    be byte-identical to ``reg=60`` in every sample checked. Practical
    consequences for THIS shape family only: (1) this function's own
    ``old_zp_x``/``new_zp_x`` values are not free parameters independent
    of the binary-cluster switch's own state -- patching zp_x here also
    changes which of the switch's own alternate states the stream reads
    as being in, whether or not that is what a caller intended; (2) this
    is very likely part of what the second caveat above ("~20 bytes
    beyond this unit... also move with zp_x alone, at offsets this
    project has not decoded") was actually seeing, since the binary-
    cluster switch is a real, coordinated 28-byte flip, not an isolated
    zp_x-adjacent artifact -- not confirmed by direct byte-offset
    cross-reference here, flagged as a plausible connection for whoever
    chases the remaining ~20 bytes next, not claimed as settled; (3)
    this function's own existing hardware-adjacent verification
    (``tests/test_axera_conv_zpx_generator.py``) used a DIFFERENT,
    unaffected shape (``Conv(cin=1,cout=1,hw=8,k=3)``), confirmed
    directly to sit at a different offset with values that don't
    resemble a switch pair -- that verification is not called into
    question by this caveat, only patches against the `dilation=3`
    shape family are. Whether an analogous collision exists for
    ``patch_mul_zp_x`` on any Mul shape has not been checked.

    The 3-byte operand is ``4c 05 <1024 // k - 1>``, decoded from Gemm's
    native `Gemm` op (``tests/test_axera_gemm_bank_81_e1_decode.py``,
    merged) and independently reconfirmed byte-identical for a

    value, for every ``K`` both files tested. Verified directly against
    real committed fixtures in

    **What this narrow capability does NOT give you.** This predicts one
    field's own correct byte value for a shape that would trigger bank
    ``0x81`` at all -- it does not decode, and this function does not
    check, whether a given ``(K, N)`` pair actually lands in the
    ``0x81``-alone regime in the first place (that switch is itself a
    multi-plateau function of both ``K`` and ``N`` together, only
    partially mapped -- see ``tests/test_axera_gemm_e1_threshold_formula.py``
    and its own siblings). Nor does it establish that this field is
    SAFE to patch in place in an arbitrary target stream without the
    rest of the stream reflowing, the same caution ``patch_site_a``'s
    own docstring already raises for this project's other shape-derived
    fields (Gemm's ``K*M-1``, Conv's dilation/orientation fields): a
    decoded formula for a field's own value is a necessary but not
    sufficient condition for that field to be *generatable* in a target
    stream this function did not itself compile.

    **This was tested directly, not left as a hedge (2026-09-18).**
    Patching a real ``K=512`` reference build's own two field=192
    records to this function's own ``K=256``-predicted operand, then
    diffing the result byte-for-byte against a REAL, independently-built
    ``K=256`` reference -- the same ground-truth-comparison bar
    ``patch_matmul_a_scale``'s own form-crossing check and
    ``patch_conv_zp_x``'s own zp_x check used -- finds the two are not
    remotely close: the raw stream lengths themselves already differ
    (4368 vs 3792 bytes, a 576-byte gap no in-place byte patch can ever
    close), and even over their shared 3792-byte prefix, 2776 bytes
    differ (73%), with the first mismatch at byte 36 -- nowhere near
    either copy of the patched field itself (bytes 533 and 1172). The
    reverse direction (``K=256`` source patched to ``K=512``'s own
    predicted value, diffed against a real ``K=512`` build) shows the
    identical picture: same 2776/3792 diff count, same first-mismatch
    offset. This is confined-vs-scattered-diff evidence, and it is
    unambiguously scattered -- worse than ``patch_matmul_a_scale``'s own
    201-byte, single-region reflow for a form-crossing MatMul edit. The
    patched stream still round-trips through ``mcode.decode()``/
    ``mcode.check()`` with zero grammar errors either direction -- a
    weak, uninformative signal on its own (this project's grammar does
    not validate semantic correctness, only structural well-formedness)
    -- but it is NOT a real ``K=256`` build by any byte-level measure.
    See ``tests/test_axera_bank81_field192_patch_verify.py`` for the
    exact fixture pair and byte counts. **Conclusion: this field is
    understood, not generatable** -- changing ``K`` restructures nearly
    the entire compiled stream (consistent with ``K`` being Gemm's own
    real contraction dimension, driving tiling/scheduling throughout),
    not just this one field's own recorded value.

    that permutation, at the same fixed offsets, with the rest of the

    ``slot1`` is ``(class, tag)`` -- always labeled ``reg=174``.

    ``8``/``242``/``176`` (the register-label pool PR #1580 found
    those two slots draw from). ``class`` is one of ``"P1"``/``"P2"``/
    ``"P3"``/``"P4"``; the 3 slots must use 3 DISTINCT classes with
    zero duplicates -- unlike Gemm's own duplicate-tolerant version
    (``tests/test_axera_gemm_reg8_second_noise_source.py``), Conv's
    mechanism was found to hold this with zero exceptions across all 8
    real builds checked. ``P4``'s own payload is always the 1-byte
    short form (``0x30``) -- observed in every one of its 3
    occurrences across the 8 real samples regardless of which slot it
    lands in, never the 3-byte long form the other 3 classes use.

    ``reg=172``'s own tag is derived automatically (``134`` iff
    ``slot1``'s class is ``"P4"``, else ``132``) -- the exact
    biconditional PR #1580 verified with zero exceptions.

    **Every slot's own record tag must be supplied explicitly, not
    just slot1's -- two previously-unnoticed wrinkles, surfaced
    building this function, not by PR #1580's own original decode**
    (whose own ``EXPECTED`` table discarded each slot record's own tag
    entirely, keeping only ``(reg, class)``): slot1's own tag is
    ``130`` in 7 of 8 real builds but ``132`` in one
    (``conv_dilation3_v7stability_r0.mcode.gz``, an otherwise-identical
    long-form ``P2`` slot1); separately, slot2/slot3's own tag is
    ``130`` in every occurrence of ``reg=8``/``242`` but ``132`` in the
    corpus's one ``reg=176`` occurrence
    (``conv_dilation3_v7stability_r1.mcode.gz``). Whether ``132``
    tracks "first time this register label is used" or something else
    is not decoded here -- with only 2 exceptions in 24 total slot
    observations, there isn't enough data in this project's own corpus
    to tell. Rather than silently defaulting past this and risking a
    plausible-looking but wrong emission, every slot's tag is a
    required, explicit argument (matching PR #1580's own established
    value, ``130``, is the safe default for any NEW, not-yet-observed
    configuration, but callers reproducing a specific real build must
    pass that build's own actual per-slot values).

    Locates the group by ``reg=170``'s own stable, byte-identical-
    across-all-8-samples anchor record (``00 12 84 aa``) -- searched
    for, not hardcoded to a fixed offset. **This is a length-changing
    edit, unlike ``emit_matmul_reg8_quad``'s fixed-size splice**: the
    group's own total byte length is 24 or 26 bytes depending on
    whether slot1's class is ``"P4"`` (short form) or not, and the OLD
    group being replaced may be either length regardless of what the
    NEW one is -- the old group's own true length is walked byte-by-
    byte from the reference's own p-bytes (not assumed), and
    everything after it is shifted accordingly.

    **The length change is now handled automatically (2026-09-18).**
    Earlier versions of this function returned the raw length-changed
    stream directly, which left ``mcode.check()`` reporting a real
    error (``"tail: no readable segment table"``) whenever the edit
    actually changed the group's own total length -- ``retarget_tail_vector``
    (below) decoded the shared root cause (a stale FlatBuffers-style
    relative-uoffset header word) and fixed it; this function now calls
    it internally before returning, so callers no longer need a manual
    second step. Verified in
    ``tests/test_axera_conv_reg8_emit_verify.py`` against all 8 real
    Pulsar2 builds this project has of ``Conv(k=3, dilation=3, pad=3,
    cin=4, cout=4, insz=16)``, including every length-changing
    cross-fixture case that used to be broken: the result now passes
    ``mcode.check()`` cleanly regardless of whether the edit changed
    the group's own total length.

    **What this establishes and does not.** A no-op emit (using each
    fixture's own exact observed configuration, including its own
    per-slot tags) reproduces that fixture byte-for-byte in every one
    of the 8 cases. Emitting a DIFFERENT real fixture's own
    configuration into another fixture's base stream always re-decodes
    to exactly that target configuration, with the rest of the stream
    (outside the reg=8 group and the one retargeted header word)
    byte-identical to the original reference. This function does NOT
    establish end-to-end shape-to-mcode generation, that an untested
    ``(class, reg, tag)`` combination not seen in these 8 samples is
    something a real Pulsar2 build would produce, or anything about
    device-level correctness -- the same scope limits
    ``emit_matmul_reg8_quad``'s own docstring already states. Nor does
    the tail-vector fix establish semantic validity, only structural
    well-formedness by this project's own grammar (``retarget_tail_vector``'s
    own docstring).

    as, not how many bytes there are.

    Given that real complexity, this function does not attempt to
    SYNTHESIZE an arbitrary caller-chosen slot assignment from
    scratch (which would require independently re-deriving exactly
    which byte encodes what under which of the two anchor forms, a
    real risk of getting subtly wrong) -- it instead extracts a real,
    already-*compiled* group verbatim from a donor build (itself one
    of the 8 already-observed real Pulsar2 outputs, or any other
    stream this function's own bounds-search succeeds on) and splices
    it whole into the reference stream, which is safe precisely
    because the spliced bytes are never anything other than bytes a
    real Pulsar2 build actually produced. This is a genuine, if more
    conservative, generation capability: given a target reference
    build and a *menu* of already-observed donor group states (this
    project's own real fixture corpus already provides several), a
    generator can choose which one to splice in.

    **What this establishes and does not.** Verified in
    ``tests/test_axera_gemm_reg8_emit_verify.py`` against all 8 real
    ``Gemm(1,512,1000)`` fixtures:

    - A no-op splice (any donor identical to the reference, including
      ``donor_mcode is reference_mcode``) reproduces the reference
      byte-for-byte, for all 8.
    - Splicing a donor whose anchor uses the SAME form as the
      reference's own (the 8 fixtures split cleanly into two groups of
      4 by anchor form -- short/21-byte-span, long/23-byte-span; all 12
      ordered same-group cross-pairs checked) preserves the total
      stream length, round-trips through ``mcode.decode()``/
      ``mcode.check()`` with zero hard errors, and reads back exactly
      the donor's own slot assignment and ``reg=0`` indicator state,
      with everything outside the spliced span byte-identical to the
      original reference.
    - Splicing ACROSS anchor forms (a length-changing splice, e.g. a
      21-byte donor group into a 23-byte reference span or vice versa)
      used to reliably produce a specific hard ``mcode.check()`` error
      -- ``"tail: no readable segment table (no header word points at a
      tail table vector)"``. **This is now fixed automatically
      (2026-09-18).** ``retarget_tail_vector`` (below) decoded the
      shared root cause (a stale FlatBuffers-style relative-uoffset
      header word left over from the length change) and this function
      now calls it internally before returning: verified in
      ``tests/test_axera_gemm_reg8_emit_verify.py`` against both
      cross-anchor-form directions, the spliced result now passes
      ``mcode.check()`` cleanly, decodes to exactly the donor's own
      slot assignment and ``reg=0`` indicator state, and leaves
      everything outside the spliced group (and the one retargeted
      header word) byte-identical to the original reference.

    It does NOT establish that every one of the 3^3 = 27 mathematically
    conceivable slot-class combinations (ignoring form/duplicate
    subtleties entirely) is itself a valid Pulsar2 output, nor does it
    attempt the harder problem ``emit_matmul_reg8_quad`` solved of
    accepting an arbitrary caller-chosen assignment directly -- only 8
    real, verified group states (4 same-length pairs each) are known to
    be safe to splice as of this function. Nor does the tail-vector fix
    establish semantic validity, only structural well-formedness by
    this project's own grammar (``retarget_tail_vector``'s own
    docstring).

    """Fix the ONE shared root cause behind every length-changing edit's
    ``mcode.check()`` failure this session's own generator work has hit:
    ``emit_conv_reg8_group``'s length-changing reconfigurations and
    ``emit_gemm_reg8_group``'s cross-anchor-form splices both reliably
    produce the identical hard error, ``"tail: no readable segment table
    (no header word points at a tail table vector)"``
    (``tests/test_axera_reg8_emit_capability_synthesis.py``, PR #1631,
    named this as a recurring, never-decoded failure mode across 3
    independent functions).

    **The mechanism, decoded directly against real broken output from
    both functions.** ``mcode.tail_vector()`` (``scripts/axera/mcode.py``)
    locates an mcode stream's tail FlatBuffers vector by scanning the
    fixed-size header (the first ~297 bytes, or up to the convolution-
    engine channel-extent marker ``a1 00 40 02`` for graphs that have
    one) for a 4-byte little-endian word ``w`` at some offset ``o`` such
    that ``o + w`` points at a valid-looking vector -- a FlatBuffers-
    style *relative* uoffset. Every ``reg=8`` group (and, more generally,
    every one of this project's own decoded resource-model fields) lives
    well AFTER this header, and BEFORE the tail vector itself -- so when
    an edit changes that region's own total length, the true tail vector
    shifts by the same delta, but the header's own stored *relative*
    uoffset does not, since none of this session's own emit functions
    touch bytes before offset ~300. Confirmed directly at a single
    concrete offset (``o=272`` for the `Conv(dilation=3)`/`Gemm(1,512,1000)`
    shape family this was checked against) via the four cases below --
    but this function does not hardcode that offset; it re-locates ``o``
    fresh from ``reference_mcode`` every call, the same defensive
    posture every other locate-by-content function in this file uses.

    ``reference_mcode`` must be the UNEDITED stream ``edited_mcode`` was
    derived from (so this function can locate the tail vector's own
    correct OLD position and offset word before the edit) --
    ``len(edited_mcode) - len(reference_mcode)`` is taken directly as the
    length delta to apply; no assumption is made about WHERE within the
    stream that length changed, only that it happened somewhere after
    the header region this function scans.

    **What this establishes and does not.** Verified in
    ``tests/test_axera_tail_table_mechanism.py`` against all 4 already-
    known broken cases from this session's own prior work -- both
    directions of ``emit_conv_reg8_group``'s own length-changing
    reconfiguration (shrink and grow) and both directions of
    ``emit_gemm_reg8_group``'s own cross-anchor-form splice: applying
    this function to each function's own broken output makes
    ``mcode.check()`` report zero hard errors, ``mcode.segments()``
    tile exactly to the (correctly relocated) tail vector, and
    ``mcode.decode()`` succeed -- a genuine fix, not merely a
    check-passes technicality, confirmed 4/4. It does NOT fix
    ``bank81_field192_operand``'s own K-changing reflow (tested
    directly, and correctly found not to need fixing by this function:
    that edit is length-PRESERVING -- a 1-byte in-place value overwrite
    -- so it never triggers this specific tail-vector error in the
    first place; ``mcode.check()`` already reports it clean, per
    ``tests/test_axera_bank81_field192_patch_verify.py``'s own finding
    that the patched stream "still decodes/checks cleanly" despite being
    semantically wrong. Field192's own problem is that `K` drives the
    ENTIRE stream's tiling/scheduling, not a single stale pointer --
    a fundamentally different, and NOT locally fixable, class of
    failure). This function also does NOT establish that a
    length-changed stream it retargets is a valid Pulsar2 output
    semantically (only that it is structurally well-formed by this
    project's own grammar) -- the same "syntactically valid, not proven
    to be what Pulsar2 would produce" scope every other emit function in
    this file already carries. Composing this with the length-changing
    emit functions it fixes -- so a caller never has to call it
    separately -- is a natural next step, not attempted here.

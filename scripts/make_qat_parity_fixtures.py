"""Emit the reference step-graph fixtures the Python<->C++ parity test compares.

``onnxsim/qat_graph_builder.{h,cpp}`` is a C++ port of the emitter half of
``onnxsim/qat_graph.py``. Two implementations of one emitter that quietly
disagree would give the browser a training loop that behaves differently from
the Python for the same model, and nothing would say so -- the graphs would
both be valid, both run, and produce different weights. That is the whole
hazard of having ported it, and a comment cannot hold the line.

So this writes down what the *Python* emitter produces for a set of canonical
sequences, and both sides are then checked against that one artifact:

- ``tests/test_qat_parity.py`` asserts the fixture still matches what
  ``qat_graph.py`` emits today, which is what catches the Python side drifting
  away from a stale fixture;
- ``onnxsim/qat_graph_parity_test.cpp`` asserts the C++ emitter reproduces the
  same fixture.

Fixture == Python and fixture == C++ together give Python == C++, which is the
property actually wanted and which neither test could establish alone. It is
the same shape as ``scripts/convertmodel/test/step_graphs.json``: a generated
artifact committed to the tree, with a test on each side that fails loudly
when it goes stale rather than silently accepting it.

**What is compared, and what deliberately is not.** Node op types, input and
output *names*, attributes, and initializer names/dtypes/shapes/values, all in
emission order. Tensor *names* are included on purpose rather than normalized
away: ``GraphBuilder``'s counter is what makes them, so identical names mean
the two emitters ran the same operations in the same order, which is a much
stronger statement than "the graphs are isomorphic" and is the property that
actually breaks first when someone reorders a rule. What is *not* compared is
the byte encoding of a tensor -- ``onnx.numpy_helper.from_array`` and a
hand-built C++ ``TensorProto`` may legitimately choose ``float_data`` versus
``raw_data`` for the same values, and a runtime cannot tell the difference.

**Why a flat text format rather than JSON.** The consumer on the other side is
a C++ test, and the repository vendors no JSON parser; pulling one in to read a
test fixture would be a dependency bought for one file. A line-oriented format
costs each side a serializer of a few dozen lines and no parser at all, because
the comparison is then string equality -- and a failure prints as a readable
diff of exactly the nodes that moved, instead of a structural mismatch report
somebody has to decode.

Floats are written as their IEEE-754 bit pattern in hex rather than as decimal
text. Decimal formatting differs between Python's ``repr`` and C++'s streams
for the same value, which would produce spurious mismatches; the bit pattern is
exact, identical in both languages, and makes the comparison sharp precisely
where it needs to be. ``1 - beta`` narrowed from double is ``0x3dcccccd`` and
the float32-subtracted version is ``0x3dcccccf``: one hex digit apart, and
unmissable.

Usage:
    python3 scripts/make_qat_parity_fixtures.py

Writes ``onnxsim/qat_parity_fixtures.txt``. Re-run it whenever the emitter
changes on purpose, and commit the result alongside.

"""Export a curated set of real instruct LMs to Core ML in one pass.

A batch wrapper around `export_llm_to_coreml.py`: runs its pipeline once per
model in `BENCHMARK_MODELS` (or a `--only` subset), each into its own
subdirectory, so the result is a ready-to-go directory of `.mlpackage`s --
`run_llm_decode_benchmark.py` can then be pointed at each one in turn to
produce the actual decode tok/s and peak-RSS numbers this whole `scripts/apple`
directory exists to measure (see that script's and `export_llm_to_coreml.py`'s
docstrings for what those numbers do and don't mean).

`BENCHMARK_MODELS` targets the same rough weight class DeviceMark's own
on-device LLM leaderboard tests (https://devicemark.github.io/, roughly
0.8-5B parameters; its own current roster -- Qwen3.5, LFM2.5, Granite-4.0-H,
and others, none of them below -- runs on a private on-device engine, not
Core ML; see `bench/TODO_quality_retention_eval.md`), spanning a few
architecture families (Llama-style, Qwen2, Phi-3) rather than just one, since
`onnxsim/coreml_export.py`'s translator is a hand-written ONNX-to-MIL mapping
and different architectures exercise different op combinations.

A few model families in that weight class require accepting a license on
Hugging Face and an authenticated `HF_TOKEN` to even download.
`meta-llama/Llama-3.2-*-Instruct` is in the default list below anyway: this
repo's CI has a read-only `HF_TOKEN` secret (see
`.github/workflows/coreml-integration.yml`'s `export-benchmark-models` job),
so it downloads there even though it can't in a token-less environment (set
`HF_TOKEN` yourself, or run `huggingface-cli login`, to download it locally).
`google/gemma-2-*-it` is left out of the default list even so -- Gemma 2's
architecture (alternating sliding-window/full attention, logit soft-capping)
hasn't been checked against this translator at all, unlike Llama-3.2's, which
only extends already-validated Llama-family op patterns to a gated checkpoint.
Pass `--only google/gemma-2-2b-it` to try it anyway; nothing about the
pipeline itself is family-specific, so it may well just work.

Not every model in the default list has actually been run through this
pipeline in every environment -- each entry's `notes` field says whether it
has been (and if not, why: usually that converting a multi-billion-parameter
model needs several GB of free RAM and disk, more than a constrained sandbox
has -- see `export_llm_to_coreml.py`'s module docstring for the memory
considerations that scale brings). Treat an unvalidated entry as "expected to
convert, based on the same op patterns validated models already exercise",
not as a guarantee.

Usage:
    # Export everything in BENCHMARK_MODELS into ./benchmark_models/<slug>/model.mlpackage
    python prepare_benchmark_models.py --output-dir benchmark_models

    # Just one model
    python prepare_benchmark_models.py --only Qwen/Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct

    # Then, per model, on macOS:
    python run_llm_decode_benchmark.py benchmark_models/Qwen_Qwen2_5_1_5B_Instruct/model.mlpackage \\
        --prompt "The capital of France is" --max-new-tokens 20

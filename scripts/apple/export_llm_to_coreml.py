"""Export a Hugging Face causal LM to a real KV-cache Core ML decoder.

Bridges a "decoder-with-past" ONNX export (produced by `optimum-onnx`,
https://github.com/huggingface/optimum-onnx) to `onnxsim.export_coreml`. Unlike
a plain static-shape export, this keeps `sequence_length` and
`past_sequence_length` as genuinely dynamic axes all the way through to the
Core ML model (via `onnxsim.export_coreml`'s `dynamic_shapes` argument, see
`onnxsim/coreml_export.py`), so the resulting `.mlpackage` is one model that
supports both:

- **prefill**: one forward pass over the whole prompt (`sequence_length` =
  prompt length, `past_sequence_length` = 0), producing the initial cache.
- **decode**: one forward pass per new token (`sequence_length` = 1),
  consuming and extending the growing cache from the previous step.

This is a real, O(1)-per-decode-step KV cache -- each step only computes the
new token's attention over the accumulated `present_*` cache from every prior
step, instead of reprocessing the whole context window every time.
`run_llm_decode_benchmark.py` is the harness that actually runs this model
and carries the cache across steps.

Only `batch_size` is pinned to a concrete value (1); `sequence_length`,
`past_sequence_length`, and the composite `past_sequence_length +
sequence_length` axis ONNX exporters emit for the attention mask are left
dynamic, bounded by `--max-context-length` (the largest prompt + generated
tokens the exported model will accept).

`optimum`'s tracer cannot trace a `sequence_length` of exactly 1 for
Llama-family models without corrupting the attention mask (see
`onnx_export_from_model`'s "sequence length of 1" check) -- this only affects
which shape is used to *trace* the model, not what shapes the exported graph
accepts at runtime, so this script traces with `sequence_length=2` and lets
`onnxsim.simplify` + the dynamic Core ML export handle the true dynamic
range, `sequence_length=1` decode steps included.

Pipeline: `optimum.exporters.onnx` (decoder-with-past, dynamic axes) -> pin
`batch_size` to 1 -> `onnxsim.simplify` -> `onnxsim.export_coreml` with
`dynamic_shapes` for `sequence_length` / `past_sequence_length` / their sum.

`--dtype` (default `fp32`) controls the precision the ONNX graph itself is
traced and computed in -- separate from Core ML's own output precision,
which defaults to float16 regardless (coremltools' `compute_precision`).
For a multi-billion-parameter model, tracing in float32 means PyTorch and
the in-progress ONNX graph can hold more than one full-size copy of the
model's weights at once (well over the model's own on-disk size); `--dtype
fp16` roughly halves that peak.

`--quantize-weights` (default `none`) applies
`coremltools.optimize.coreml.linear_quantize_weights` to the *converted*
Core ML model, replacing each weight `const` with
`constexpr_affine_dequantize`/`constexpr_blockwise_shift_scale` (int8 or
int4, per-channel, dequantized to float on the fly at compute time). See
README.md's "Theoretical ceiling" section for why this is the lever worth
pulling for *decode* specifically: a single-token decode step is
memory-bandwidth-bound (the compute per token is tiny; the entire weight
set has to be read from DRAM once per token regardless, since nothing
amortizes that read across tokens at batch size 1), so halving weight
bytes is a direct, roughly-proportional lever on decode tok/s -- unlike
Core ML's packed W8A8 *compute* path (int8 weights **and** activations, up
to ~2x compute throughput on the M4 ANE), which this flag does not use:
weight-only quantization keeps activations and compute in float, so it
doesn't touch the compute-bound side of the ceiling at all, only the
bandwidth-bound side that actually matters for decode at these model
sizes. Applied after conversion (not baked into the ONNX graph), so it's
independent of `--dtype`, which only controls tracing/export precision.
`int4` needs `minimum_deployment_target=iOS18` (coremltools refuses lower
targets for 4-bit weights); this script sets that automatically only for
`int4`, since `int8`/`none` already work at whatever target
`onnxsim.export_coreml` otherwise picks. `--minimum-deployment-target` lets a
caller force a higher target regardless of `--quantize-weights` -- needed by
`coreml-integration.yml`'s compute-plan-trace step, since `MLComputePlan`'s
per-operation device/cost APIs return no data for a model built below their
own SDK floor (see `coreml_compute_plan_trace.m`).

`--matmul-to-conv` (default off) targets the *other* side of the ceiling --
compute, not bandwidth -- for the cases where compute still matters (e.g.
prefill's whole-prompt forward pass, or a bigger batch than this pipeline
currently does). It lowers each attention/MLP projection's `MatMul` to a
1x1/pointwise `conv` (`onnxsim.coreml_export`'s `matmul_to_conv`, see
`onnxsim.export_coreml`'s docstring for exactly which shapes qualify): the
Apple Neural Engine's compute array parallelizes over convolution output
channels and its native matmul path measures well below conv1x1's throughput
on the same hardware -- see README.md's "Theoretical ceiling" section for the
measurements. This flag is a translator-level structural change (unlike
`--quantize-weights`, it can in principle affect numeric behavior through a
different-but-equivalent op sequence, though the underlying math is
identical), and it has not been measured on real Core ML yet -- it exists so
`coreml-integration.yml`'s `benchmark-decode-macos` job can actually measure
whether it helps *this* pipeline's shapes (mostly single-token decode, unlike
the deep/wide conv1x1 chains the cited measurements used) before anyone
enables it by default.

`--io-dtype fp16` (default `fp32`) changes the exported model's *interface*
rather than anything inside it: every float input and output is declared
float16, so Core ML stops converting them at the boundary on every call. An ML
Program already computes in float16 (`compute_precision`'s default), so an
fp32 interface only buys a down-conversion on the way in and an up-conversion
on the way out, over twice the bytes. This pipeline is the shape that pays
most for that: the KV cache crosses the boundary twice per decode step (in as
`past_key_values_*`, out as `present_*`) and is by far the largest thing
moving, growing with every token generated. The ANE reverse-engineering work
behind README.md's "Theoretical ceiling" numbers measures direct fp16 I/O at
roughly 37% faster than fp32 I/O over the same buffers
(https://github.com/maderix/ANE, "How It Works" step 3). Unlike
`--quantize-weights` it changes no stored value and unlike `--matmul-to-conv`
it changes no op, so it costs nothing in accuracy relative to the default --
the computation was fp16 on both sides of the flag; only whether the caller
sees the fp16 value directly or an upcast copy of it changes.
`run_llm_decode_benchmark.py` and `check_decode_parity.py` both read their
feed dtypes off the model's own spec, so they work against either interface
unchanged.

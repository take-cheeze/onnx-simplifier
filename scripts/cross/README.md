# Cross-compiling Windows wheels on Linux

This directory builds an onnxsim **Windows** (x86_64) wheel from a **Linux**
host, so the expensive C++ compile can run on a cheap Ubuntu runner. The wheel
is then handed to a Windows runner purely for `pytest`.

`.github/workflows/build-and-test.yml` wires the two halves together (the
`build_wheels_windows_cross` and `test_wheels_windows_cross` jobs), producing
the Windows release wheels in place of a native Windows build:

```
build_wheels_windows_cross (ubuntu-24.04)  ->  test_wheels_windows_cross (windows-2025)
  llvm-mingw cross-build                         uv install the wheel + run tests
```

## Why not cibuildwheel?

cibuildwheel only builds Windows wheels **on a Windows host** — it will not
cross-build them on Linux. So the Ubuntu job is a hand-written cross-compile
instead of a cibuildwheel invocation. The Windows job is a plain test runner.

## Toolchains (`BACKEND`)

Two toolchains are supported; the workflow uses **llvm-mingw**.

* **`llvm-mingw`** (default) — clang + lld + a self-contained UCRT/libc++
  sysroot ([llvm-mingw](https://github.com/mstorsjo/llvm-mingw)). No Microsoft
  SDK download; the C++ runtime is statically linked so the wheel ships no
  extra DLLs. Targets the UCRT, matching modern python.org CPython. The C++ ABI
  differs from MSVC, but that is invisible to CPython — only the extern-`"C"`
  `PyInit_*` entry point crosses the boundary, and every dependency (onnx,
  protobuf, abseil, nanobind) is built with this same toolchain. nanobind
  officially supports MinGW-w64.
* **`clang-cl`** — clang in MSVC mode against an MSVC CRT + Windows SDK fetched
  with [`xwin`](https://github.com/Jake-Shadle/xwin). Produces a genuine
  MSVC-ABI binary; kept as an alternative.

Select with `BACKEND=llvm-mingw` / `BACKEND=clang-cl`. Each has a matching
`windows-<backend>.toolchain.cmake`.

## How the cross-build works (`build_windows_wheel.sh`)

1. **Toolchain** — download llvm-mingw (or the MSVC SDK via xwin).
2. **Target CPython** headers + import libraries from the official CPython
   [NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/python). Its `python3.lib`
   imports the stable-ABI `python3.dll` (python-build-standalone's imports the
   versioned `pythonXY.dll` instead), so the abi3 build links `python3.lib` and
   produces a wheel that loads on any CPython >= 3.12.
3. **Host `protoc`** (a Linux protobuf build) runs ONNX's code generation via
   `ONNX_CUSTOM_PROTOC_EXECUTABLE`; a cross-built `protoc.exe` could not run on
   the Linux host. Built with the host compiler — the target toolchain is kept
   off `PATH` here, since llvm-mingw's `clang` defaults to a Windows target.
4. **Target abseil + protobuf** cross-built so ONNX has something to link.
   Versions come from ONNX's SBOM so the host `protoc` and target `libprotobuf`
   always match.
5. **onnxsim's nanobind extension** cross-built against all of the above. A
   small portability patch (`onnx-msvc-portability.patch`) is applied to the
   vendored onnx first: onnx's Windows code uses a reinterpret-cast pointer as a
   non-type template argument and a case-sensitive `<Windows.h>`, both of which
   only MSVC's `cl.exe` accepts — Clang (clang-cl and mingw alike) rejects them.
   The patch is applied idempotently at build time and reverts cleanly; it is a
   candidate for upstreaming to onnx.
6. **`assemble_wheel.py`** packs the `.pyd` into a correctly tagged wheel
   (setup.py cannot drive packaging when cross-compiling, as it assumes the
   host's extension suffix and build layout).

When `sccache` is on `PATH`, it is used as the CMake compiler launcher for every
stage, so object files (host protoc, target abseil/protobuf, onnx/onnxsim) are
cached across runs. The workflow provides it via `mozilla-actions/sccache-action`
with the GitHub Actions cache backend, matching `build-and-test.yml`; the first
run is a cold cache, later runs reuse it.

## Scope / status

* Covers the Windows CPython versions shipped by `build-and-test.yml`:
  **3.11, 3.12, 3.13**. This cross-build **is** the Windows release path —
  it replaces the native Windows build, and its wheels are published to PyPI by
  the `upload_pypi` job alongside the natively-built Linux/macOS wheels.
* **3.12 and 3.13 share one `cp312-abi3` wheel**: a genuine limited-API module
  (nanobind sets `Py_LIMITED_API` and links nuget's `python3.lib`, so the `.pyd`
  imports `python3.dll`). **3.11** is below nanobind's abi3 floor
  (3.12), so it gets a **version-specific** wheel (`ABI3=0`, tag `cp3XX-cp3XX`,
  linking `pythonXY.dll`).
* onnxruntime is **not** compiled in (`-DONNXSIM_BUILTIN_ORT=OFF`, matching the
  pip build), keeping the cross-compile surface to onnx + protobuf + nanobind.

## Running it locally

Requires cmake, ninja, a host C/C++ compiler, `pip install nanobind`, and
network access (downloads llvm-mingw + the target CPython). For `clang-cl` you
additionally need `xwin` on `PATH`, which downloads the MSVC SDK from Microsoft.

```sh
BACKEND=llvm-mingw PYVER=3.12 ABI3=1 bash scripts/cross/build_windows_wheel.sh
# -> wheelhouse/onnxsim-<ver>-cp312-abi3-win_amd64.whl
```

# Cross-building for s390x (big endian)

The second cross-build in this directory targets **s390x Linux**, for a
different reason than the Windows one: not to ship wheels, but to run onnxsim's
test suite on a **big-endian** CPU. ONNX defines `TensorProto.raw_data` as
little-endian on every host, so any code that reinterprets those bytes in host
order is a latent bug that only x86/ARM's byte order hides. s390x is the only
mainstream big-endian Linux target a major distro still supports, and Ubuntu
ships `python3-onnx` / `python3-numpy` / `python3-pytest` for it — which is what
makes this practical, since PyPI has no s390x wheels.

Everything is compiled by the **host** toolchain (`s390x-linux-gnu-g++`), so the
build runs at native speed; only the resulting binaries execute under
`qemu-s390x-static`. An emulated build of the onnx + protobuf stack would take
hours.

## Procedure

```sh
# 1. Ubuntu s390x rootfs + binfmt_misc -> qemu-s390x-static  (root; once)
sudo bash scripts/cross/bootstrap_s390x_rootfs.sh

# 2. Cross-build the extension (host protoc, target abseil/protobuf, onnxsim)
bash scripts/cross/build_s390x_extension.sh

# 3. Install it into the rootfs and run pytest there, big endian
sudo bash scripts/cross/run_s390x_tests.sh
```

## The little-endian control

A big-endian test run on its own is hard to read: a failure may be an
endianness bug, or just an artifact of this unusual environment (no
onnxruntime, no torch, an older distro onnx). So build the **same commit** for
x86_64 and run the **same suite** in an amd64 rootfs with the **same package
versions**. Then byte order is the only variable and the two failure sets can be
diffed directly:

```sh
sudo ARCH=amd64 bash scripts/cross/bootstrap_s390x_rootfs.sh
bash scripts/cross/build_native_control.sh
sudo SYSROOT=/rootfs-amd64 BUILD=$PWD/.native-build-control/onnxsim-build \
     bash scripts/cross/run_s390x_tests.sh
```

## Notes / gotchas

* **binfmt magic must mask `EI_OSABI`.** glibc's own binaries (notably
  `ldconfig.real`) are tagged `ELFOSABI_GNU`, so a handler that pins byte 7 to
  SYSV makes exactly those fail with `Exec format error` part-way through
  `debootstrap`, corrupting the dpkg status file. The mask also has to accept
  `ET_DYN` for static-pie binaries.
* **The host interpreter must match the target CPython's X.Y.** CMake's
  `FindPython` validates the interpreter against the target headers and refuses
  a mismatch, even though the interpreter only runs ONNX's codegen.
* **The distro's `python3-onnx` is too old** for onnxsim's vendored onnx and
  fails a large part of the suite for reasons unrelated to byte order.
  `run_s390x_tests.sh` therefore installs the vendored onnx (assembled from the
  same cross-build) ahead of it on `PYTHONPATH`. protobuf has a pure-Python
  wheel, so it needs no s390x build; `ml_dtypes` does not, and is compiled once
  inside the rootfs under emulation by the bootstrap script.
* onnxruntime, torch and timm have no s390x builds, so the test modules that
  import them at module scope cannot be collected. onnxsim falls back to onnx's
  reference evaluator, which is the supported no-onnxruntime path.

## In CI

`.github/workflows/big-endian.yml` runs all three steps plus `ctest`. It is
weekly, on demand, and on pull requests touching the harness or the files that
read and write `raw_data` — a cold run is ~40 minutes, too much for every PR.
sccache carries every compile across runs — host protoc, target
abseil/protobuf, **and** onnx/onnx-optimizer/onnxsim itself, which is the bulk
of the work. The one step the host toolchain cannot take over (compiling
`ml_dtypes` inside the rootfs under emulation) has its wheel cached separately
via `WHEELHOUSE`, at ~4 MB.

### Why the rootfs is not cached

It would be the obvious next thing to cache, and it is deliberately not:

* It is **1.1 GB across ~28k files, ~500 MB gzipped** — around 5% of the
  repository's 10 GB Actions cache budget, which it would be competing for with
  sccache, whose entries are worth far more per byte.
* It only saves the `debootstrap` step (~3 min). Restoring and unpacking half a
  gigabyte is not obviously faster than just rebuilding it.
* `actions/cache` tars as the runner user, which cannot preserve the root
  ownership, setuid bits and device nodes a chroot needs, so a restored rootfs
  would likely be subtly broken anyway.

Caching the one emulated compile instead gets the same wall-clock win for
0.7% of the storage.

### Why the bootstrap is ~280s and not much less

Measured on a 4-core runner, building the rootfs from scratch:

| package set | time | rootfs |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| the original 14 packages | 289s | 888 MB |
| current set (dead ones dropped) | 281s | 694 MB |
| also dropping `build-essential` | 216s | 384 MB |
| prebuilt `ubuntu-base` tarball + apt | 144s | 509 MB |

Stage 1 — download and native unpack — is only ~40s. The rest is dpkg
*configuring* every package under emulation, and that is what sets the floor.
Things that turned out not to help: caching the `.deb` files saves 19s for a
57 MB cache entry, and dpkg's `force-unsafe-io` saves nothing measurable.

Two faster options were rejected on purpose:

* **Dropping `build-essential`** (216s) shifts the ml_dtypes build's
  dependencies to an `apt-get` *inside* the chroot on a cache miss, where
  unpack and configure both run emulated — an order of magnitude slower than
  debootstrap's native stage-1 unpack. With a weekly schedule and a 7-day cache
  eviction window, misses are near the norm, so this trades 65s a run against
  ten minutes on the runs that miss.
* **The prebuilt `ubuntu-base` tarball** (144s) is genuinely faster, but that
  image ships no `gpgv`, so apt cannot verify repository signatures — the
  measurement above only reached 144s with verification disabled. Trading
  package authenticity for ~140s on a ~20 min job is not a good deal.

The build, not the bootstrap, is where the time is; sccache is the lever that
matters there.

See `docs/big-endian.md` for what these runs found, and for the one known
failure the job deselects by name.

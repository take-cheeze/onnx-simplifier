"""Generates onnxsim/contrib_schemas_moe_templates.gen.h from onnxscript.

contrib_schemas.cpp attaches ONNX Runtime's `com.microsoft.MoE` schema to one
of the fixed FunctionProtos generated here, chosen purely by which optional
inputs (fc1_experts_bias, fc2_experts_bias) the calling node actually has --
that is genuinely unavoidable context-dependence: ONNX's function-inlining
requires a function call's input count to match its formal parameter list
exactly, so a function referencing an optional input directly cannot be
reused for a call site that omits it (confirmed empirically -- there is no
Optional-wrapping/If trick that fixes this, since the *node list itself*,
not just a runtime value, would need to differ). See BuildMoEFunctionBody's
own comment in contrib_schemas.cpp for the full picture of what remains
context-dependent and why.

Beyond that unavoidable bias-presence dispatch, every one of the 32 fixed
functions built here (4 activations x fc1_bias x fc2_bias, plus 8 more for
activation="silu" x fc1_bias x fc2_bias x fc3_bias, plus 8 more for
activation="swiglu" x fc1_bias x fc2_bias x swiglu_limit -- see below) is
fully generic at the ONNX level, using mechanisms a per-instance C++ codegen
pass used to paper over:

  - num_experts, unknown until a real node is inspected, is now a genuine
    ONNX `Loop` trip count (`Shape(fc1_experts_weights)[0]`) instead of a
    literal unrolled N times per node.
  - k, normalize_routing_weights, and use_sparse_mixer are forwarded from
    the calling node's own attributes via `ref_attr_name` (see
    `_bind_attribute` below) instead of being read in C++ and baked in as
    literal text. onnxscript has no direct syntax for `ref_attr_name`, so
    each is authored as a `Constant` holding a *sentinel* int (never a
    value the real math would produce) and rebound to `ref_attr_name` by
    editing the compiled FunctionProto afterwards.
  - use_sparse_mixer's choice of routing algorithm, and
    normalize_routing_weights' renormalization, are both genuine ONNX `If`
    branches on that forwarded value (onnxscript compiles a Python `if` on
    a traced graph value -- as opposed to a Python-level bool -- straight
    to an ONNX `If` node with real then/else subgraphs), not a per-instance
    choice of which template text to emit.

activation_type stays a build-time (per-function) choice rather than a
runtime branch: it is a *string* attribute, and ONNX's string-typed `Equal`
needs opset 19 (this targets opset 18, matching every op already in use);
more importantly it selects genuinely different math/ops, the same kind of
structural difference bias-presence forces above.

use_sparse_mixer's own routing math (in `_routing_lines`) is transcribed
from onnxruntime's actual CUDA kernel
(onnxruntime/contrib_ops/cuda/moe/qmoe_kernels.cu, `sparse_mixer_top2`) --
there is no CPU kernel implementing it at all, so unlike everything else
generated here it cannot be numerically checked against a running ONNX
Runtime session. It was instead cross-checked against an independent numpy
transliteration of the same CUDA source (see the PR description for the
comparison) before being transcribed a second time, here, into ONNX ops.

The 8 additional activation="silu" x fc1_bias x fc2_bias x fc3_bias
functions implement fc3 -- a real, shipping convention: onnxruntime-genai's
model builder (onnxruntime-genai/src/python/py/models/builders/phi.py,
`Phi3MoELongRoPEModel`) exports Phi-3.5-MoE-style checkpoints this way, and
it is the standard Mixtral gated-MLP shape (separate gate/up/down
projections) generally. `fc2(silu(fc1(x)) * fc3(x))` is transcribed
straight from onnxruntime's own CUDA kernel comment
(onnxruntime/contrib_ops/cuda/moe/moe.cc: "Mixtral case: SiLU activation
with separate FC3 ... Kernel supports SwiGLU which is Linear * SiLU(Gate)
... map Mixtral to SwiGLU by packing weights as [FC3, FC1] (Linear, Gate)"),
not guessed from the schema doc comments alone. Like use_sparse_mixer, this
has no CPU kernel to check against -- onnxruntime's CPU MoE kernel
(onnxruntime/contrib_ops/cpu/moe/moe_cpu.cc) rejects fc3 unconditionally
("FC3 is not implemented for CPU MoE"), for any activation -- so this is
disclosed as the same kind of validation gap as use_sparse_mixer rather than
claimed as ORT-session-verified. It is also why fc3 is only ever generated
for activation="silu": the CUDA kernel's own weight-repacking is gated on
`activation_type_ == ActivationType::Silu` specifically, so relu/identity/
gelu + fc3 has no ORT-defined behavior at all (real ORT would silently
misinterpret such a node's weights, not just skip it) and stays declined in
BuildMoEFunctionBody rather than guessing a formula for it.

The 8 additional activation="swiglu" x fc1_bias x fc2_bias x swiglu_limit
functions implement the interleaved (fusion_size=2, swiglu_fusion=1) SwiGLU
layout -- gpt-oss-20b's real, shipping convention
(activation_alpha=1.702, activation_beta=1.0, swiglu_fusion=1, per
onnxruntime-genai's gpt-oss builder) and, unlike everything added for fc3/
use_sparse_mixer above, the ONE case ONNX Runtime's own CPU MoE kernel
actually implements: its constructor
(onnxruntime/contrib_ops/cpu/moe/moe_cpu.cc) throws unless
`swiglu_fusion == 1` for a SwiGLU node, i.e. exactly this layout, so this
one *is* checked end to end against a real onnxruntime CPU session (see
`_swiglu_activation_lines`'s own comment for the formula, transcribed from
that same file's `ApplySwiGLUVectorized`). fc1_experts_weights here is
`[num_experts, 2*inter_size, hidden_size]` (fusion_size=2, per the schema
doc) with gate/linear interleaved column-by-column in its own Gemm output
(`h1[:, 0::2]`/`h1[:, 1::2]`, reproduced with a strided `Slice` since
onnxscript's Python slicing sugar has no traced-step form) -- swiglu never
takes fc3 (its own fc1 already carries both projections). activation_alpha
and activation_beta are forwarded via `ref_attr_name` like k/
normalize_routing_weights/use_sparse_mixer above (not baked in as 1.0/0.0
literals), since they can legitimately vary (gpt-oss's own 1.702/1.0
differ from the schema's own defaults) -- BuildMoEFunctionBody declines the
swiglu path entirely when either is absent from the calling node, since
forwarding needs a real attribute value on that node to bind to.
swiglu_limit is genuinely optional ("no clamp when limit is not provided",
per the schema doc), so -- unlike alpha/beta, which are unconditionally
present on every real swiglu node -- its presence is a structural, build-
time axis instead of always-forwarded: with it, the generated body adds a
`Min`/clamp pair using the forwarded value; without it, those ops are
absent entirely rather than forwarding a value that means "no-op" only by
coincidence of being infinite.

Run this script whenever the generated templates need to change:
    python3 scripts/codegen/generate_moe_function_templates.py \
        onnxsim/contrib_schemas_moe_templates.gen.h
(or with no argument, to print the generated header to stdout instead of
writing it). The output is checked into the repository rather than
generated as part of every C++ build: onnxscript is not otherwise a build
dependency of onnxsim's C++ extension, and this repo builds across many CI
matrices (Windows/macOS/ARM cross-compiles, WASM/Pyodide, s390x under
qemu) that would all need to gain it just to compile a header that only
changes when this script itself changes.
`cmake --build . --target regenerate_moe_templates` re-runs this script in
place for local iteration when onnxscript is installed; ordinary builds
never invoke it.

    fc2_bias[, fc3_bias | swiglu_limit]) fixed function -- arbitrary
    num_experts (a real ONNX `Loop`), arbitrary k/normalize_routing_weights/
    use_sparse_mixer (forwarded attributes and runtime `If`s), a single
    fixed activation (see module docstring for why that alone stays a
    build-time choice) -- via `exec`, the same technique
    contrib_schemas_moe_test.cpp's generator used before for the 16
    (activation, bias) expert-block fragments, now producing a complete
    function per combination instead of a spliced-in fragment.

    `has_fc3_bias=None` (the default) means fc3 is absent entirely -- the
    plain per-expert FFN, `fc2(activation(fc1(x)))`. `has_fc3_bias` a bool
    means fc3 is present as a second, ungated per-expert Gemm combined with
    fc1's activated output via elementwise Mul before fc2:
    `fc2(activation(fc1(x)) * fc3(x))`. Only ever called with `activation ==
    "silu"` for that case -- see BuildMoEFunctionBody's comment in
    contrib_schemas.cpp for why: this is ONNX Runtime's own "Mixtral case"
    (onnxruntime/contrib_ops/cuda/moe/moe.cc, `kernel_activation_type =
    ActivationType::Swiglu` remap + the "[FC3, FC1]" weight-packing comment
    right above it) -- silu(fc1(x)) is the kernel's "SiLU(Gate)" and fc3(x)
    its "Linear", with no analogous defined behavior for the other three
    activations.

    `has_swiglu_limit` (only meaningful, and only ever passed, for
    `activation == "swiglu"`) selects whether the generated body includes
    the optional clamp-to-`swiglu_limit` step -- see
    `_swiglu_activation_lines`'s own comment for the interleaved-layout
    formula this implements and how it was validated. `has_fc3_bias` and
    `has_swiglu_limit` are never both set: swiglu never takes fc3 (its own
    fc1 is already the fused gate+linear pair).

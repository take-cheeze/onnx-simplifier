"""Formal check for QOperatorQuantizeConv (opt-in; onnxsim's own
``onnxsim/passes/qoperator_quantize_conv.h``): the Conv-shaped sibling of
``qoperator_quantize_matmul.h`` (``test_formal_verify_qoperator_quantize_
matmul.py`` is this file's primary template for the two-layer bound
structure -- read it first) and the QOperator-format sibling of
``static_quantize_conv.h`` (``test_formal_verify_static_quantize_conv.py`` is
this file's template for adapting a MatMul-shaped bound to Conv -- read it
too). It rewrites ``Y = Conv(X, W[, B])`` (``W`` constant float32, rank >= 3;
``B`` optional) into a single ``QLinearConv`` op -- no float ``Conv`` left in
the graph at all::

    Xq = QuantizeLinear(X, Xs, Xzp)                             -- CALIBRATED
    Yq = QLinearConv(Xq, Xs, Xzp, Wq, Ws, Wzp, Ys, Yzp[, Bq])    -- true int8
    Y  = DequantizeLinear(Yq, Ys, Yzp)                           -- CALIBRATED

``Wq``/``Ws`` use ``QuantizeConvWeightPerOutputChannel`` (axis 0 -- Conv's
``[Cout, Cin/groups, k...]`` layout gives no other choice, unlike Gemm's
``transB``-dependent layout ambiguity), exactly like ``static_quantize_conv``.
``X``/``Y`` both use a single (scalar) calibrated scale/zero-point, exactly
like ``qoperator_quantize_matmul``. Needs opset >= 10 (``QLinearConv``'s own
minimum), and BOTH the activation's and the node's own output's name need a
calibrated range in ``StaticQuantizationCalibrationRanges()`` -- the same
"quantizes its own output too" requirement ``qoperator_quantize_matmul`` has,
for the same reason (no float Conv survives to absorb a dequantization step).

Soundness claim -- three layers of error
==========================================
Layer 1 (reused verbatim from ``static_quantize_conv``'s own Conv-shaped
bound, itself the MatMul template's exact formulation): once a spatial output
position and output channel ``c`` are fixed, that one output element is
exactly a dot product of the receptive-field patch of ``X``
(``Cin/groups * prod(kernel dims)`` values, flattened) against ``W[c, ...]``
(flattened the same way) -- modeled, as in every sibling file, via a small
concrete contraction dimension ``_K`` standing in for that flattened
receptive field rather than anything specific to convolution's sliding-window
structure::

    |Conv(X, W)[..., c, ...] - Y_raw[..., c, ...]| <=
        (Xs / 2) * sum_k |W[c, k]| + (Ws[c] / 2) * sum_k |X_patch[k]|
        + K * (Xs / 2) * (Ws[c] / 2)                                -- "bound1"

where ``Y_raw`` is the value ``Y`` would take if ``QLinearConv``'s own output
weren't itself re-quantized (i.e. the raw int8-conv-and-dequantize result).
Same direct-error-variable (``ex``/``ew``) idiom as every sibling file, shown
tractable at this ``_K`` throughout this suite; the same nonlinear-blowup
risk that idiom avoids (see ``test_formal_verify_dynamic_quantize_matmul.py``
for the original incident writeup) applies here unchanged.

Layer 2 (reused verbatim from ``qoperator_quantize_matmul``'s own technique):
``Yq`` is ITSELF a quantized representation of ``Y_raw``, into the fixed
calibrated ``(Ys, Yzp)`` range, with its own round-trip bound
``|Y_raw - Y| <= Ys / 2``. Composing layers 1 and 2 via the triangle
inequality is checked as its own explicit Z3 query
(``test_qoperator_quantize_conv_combined_bound_holds``), exactly like the
MatMul template: ``|Conv(X, W) - Y| <= bound1 + Ys / 2``.

Layer 3 (genuinely new to THIS pass -- the content this file adds beyond
template-copying): unlike ``qoperator_quantize_matmul``'s Gemm bias, which
stays float and is added back AFTER the output's own dequantization (so it
cancels out of the combined-bound error term algebraically, contributing
nothing new -- see that file's own bias-variant test), ``QLinearConv``'s
optional bias input has no float fallback at all. When present, ``runTransform``
quantizes it AHEAD OF TIME into a fixed, non-calibrated per-output-channel
INT32 tensor, with ``bias_scale[c] = x_scale * w_scale[c]`` and zero_point
implicitly 0 -- ``QLinearConv``'s own documented contract for its bias input
(see the ``QLinearConv_ver10`` schema comment ``qoperator_quantize_conv.h``
itself references, and that header's own doc comment above ``runTransform``).
This is NOT a free/calibrated round-trip like the activation or output: it is
an exact-formula-derived quantization whose own rounding error is bounded by
``|Bias[c] - dequant(Bias_q)[c]| <= bias_scale[c] / 2 = (Xs * Ws[c]) / 2`` --
a THIRD error term, additive via the same triangle-inequality-as-a-Z3-query
technique layer 2 already uses, folded into the bias variant of the combined
bound (``test_qoperator_quantize_conv_combined_bound_bias_variant`` below).
Because the bias itself is quantized here (unlike Gemm's untouched float
bias), this term does NOT cancel algebraically -- it is a genuine additional
additive error budget the combined bound must carry whenever a bias is
present, which a negative control below
(``test_qoperator_quantize_conv_negative_control_requires_bias_bound``)
confirms is not vacuous: dropping just the bias's own rounding-error
hypothesis (while keeping both other hypotheses) breaks the combined-with-bias
bound.

Predicate difference from ``qoperator_quantize_matmul``
==========================================================
Because there is no float fallback for a ``QLinearConv`` bias (unlike Gemm's,
which rides through untouched in float regardless of whether it's constant),
a Conv whose bias is present but NOT a constant float32 ``[Cout]`` tensor
cannot be rewritten at all and is left alone entirely --
``patternMatchPredicate``'s own distinguishing decline condition versus
``qoperator_quantize_matmul`` (whose Gemm-bias case has no such restriction).
Confirmed below as a differential test
(``test_qoperator_quantize_conv_declines_with_non_constant_bias``).

Confirming QLinearConv's CPU kernel before relying on it
===========================================================
``tests/test_qoperator_quantize_conv.py`` (this repo's own non-formal
coverage of this pass) already runs the real quantized graph -- both without
a bias (``test_quantize_conv``) and with a constant bias baked into
``QLinearConv``'s 9th input (``test_quantize_conv_with_constant_bias``) --
through ``onnxruntime.InferenceSession`` successfully; re-running that file
here (``python3 -m pytest tests/test_qoperator_quantize_conv.py -q``) confirms
it still passes in this environment. So, unlike some other ops in this suite
that need a hand-simulated fallback for a missing onnxruntime kernel (see
e.g. the FLOAT8/BFLOAT16 workarounds elsewhere in this suite), ``QLinearConv``
has a working CPU kernel here, bias input included, and the numeric-bound
differential tests below run the real quantized graph through onnxruntime
rather than a hand-simulated int8 computation.

Invoking the pass
===================
As in ``qoperator_quantize_matmul``'s own docstring: the nanobind-exposed
entry point is ``onnxsim.onnxsim_cpp2py_export.quantize_qoperator(model_bytes,
activation_ranges)``, running ``OptimizeFixed(["qoperator_quantize_matmul",
"qoperator_quantize_conv"])`` -- so it already isolates this pass family, and
``activation_ranges`` must supply a calibrated range for BOTH the Conv's
activation input's name and the Conv node's own output name (``"Y"`` for the
single-node models built below).

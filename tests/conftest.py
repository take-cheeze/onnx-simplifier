"""Pytest configuration for the test suite.

The ``--durations=10`` flag (set as a default in ``pyproject.toml``) makes pytest
print the slowest tests to the terminal. When the suite runs on GitHub Actions we
also mirror that list into the job's step summary, so the timings show up on the
run's summary page instead of being buried in the raw logs.

This file lives in ``tests/`` rather than the repo root on purpose: pytest's
default ``prepend`` import mode inserts a conftest's directory onto ``sys.path``.
A root conftest would put the repo root there, so ``import onnxsim`` would resolve
to the source tree (which has no compiled ``onnxsim_cpp2py_export`` extension)
and shadow the installed wheel during ``cibuildwheel`` tests. Keeping it under
``tests/`` only adds ``tests/`` to the path, which is already there for
collection, so the installed package is imported unchanged.

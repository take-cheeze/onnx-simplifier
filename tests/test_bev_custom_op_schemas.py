"""Tests for onnxsim's built-in schemas for the mmdeploy/mmcv/BEVDet custom
ops decomposed by this branch's rewrite_msdeformattn_to_gridsample,
rewrite_deform_conv_to_gather, rewrite_trt_batched_nms,
rewrite_trt_batched_rotated_nms, and rewrite_bev_pool_to_scatter passes
(onnxsim/bev_custom_op_schemas.cpp).

Unlike those five passes' own test files, none of these tests pass
``extra_optimizers`` or enable any rewrite pass, and none of them call
``onnx.defs.register_schema`` themselves (the pattern every one of those five
test files' ``_model()`` helpers relies on to get past its own upfront
``onnx.checker.check_model()`` call). The point here is exactly the opposite:
proving onnxsim itself, out of the box, already knows enough about these ops
-- via the schemas ``RegisterBevCustomOpSchemas()`` registers internally --
to run real shape inference through them.

The proof technique: build a graph with one custom-op node followed by a
``Shape``/``Gather`` chain that reads one dimension of the custom op's own
output. If onnxsim's shape inference can determine that dimension from the
custom op's *inputs* via a real ``TypeAndShapeInferenceFunction``, its own
constant-folding pass collapses the ``Shape``/``Gather`` chain into a literal
-- something that could not happen if the custom op's output shape were left
unresolved (the pre-existing, already-adequate-for-passing-the-checker
status quo without any of these schemas: `RegisterCustomDefaultDomainOpSchemas`
for the default domain, and onnx::checker::check_model's own tolerance for
unknown non-default-domain ops -- see bev_custom_op_schemas.h's own comment).
So a folded-to-a-literal output is not just "the model didn't get rejected";
it is a real, non-trivial re-derivation that could only have come from these
schemas' inference functions actually running.

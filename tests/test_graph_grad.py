"""Tests for ``onnxsim.graph_grad`` -- reverse-mode differentiation of an ONNX
slice, emitted as ONNX nodes.

A gradient is the one kind of code whose bugs do not announce themselves: a
wrong VJP still produces a finite number of the right shape, the optimizer
still runs, and the only symptom is that training converges somewhere
slightly worse. So almost every test here is the same experiment -- build a
small forward graph, emit its backward with
:func:`onnxsim.graph_grad.build_backward`, run both through onnxruntime, and
check the result against a central finite difference of the same forward
evaluated in float64 by onnx's reference evaluator. The finite difference is
an independent implementation in a different precision through a different
runtime, which is what makes it worth comparing against; the tolerances are
set by the float32 the backward graph itself computes in, not by the
reference.

Two things beyond correctness are also checked, for the same reason
``tests/test_qat_graph.py`` checks them: that the emitted graph stays inside
the operator allowlist the accelerator execution providers actually
implement, and that an op with no rule is refused loudly instead of silently
skipped.

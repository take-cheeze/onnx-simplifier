"""Tests for ``onnxsim.apply_block_finetune`` (see ``onnxsim/qat.py``) -- the
same block-wise, label-free distillation :func:`onnxsim.apply_qat` performs,
with the fake-quantizer taken out of the middle.

Everything that made ``apply_qat`` work is about distillation rather than about
quantization: a block, a teacher's activation at its output, a mean squared
reconstruction error, a backward pass emitted as ONNX, an Adam step.
Quantization entered at exactly one point -- the fake-quantizer between the
master weight and the block's own node -- and ``fake_quant=False`` removes it.
So most of what is worth testing here is *what did not change*, and the tests
below are shaped accordingly: the step graph has no quantizer residue in it,
the weights come back as fp32 rather than as codes, and the flags that name a
quantizer's parameters are refused rather than ignored.

Three claims are genuinely new and are therefore measured rather than asserted:

1. a perturbed model's block really is tuned back toward the reference, and by
   enough to show on a *held-out* input the tuning never saw -- the number is
   recorded in ``test_a_perturbed_model_recovers_on_a_held_out_input``;
2. the master weights are seeded from the **student**, not the teacher, which
   is the one substantive semantic difference from ``apply_qat`` and is the
   difference between fine-tuning a pruned model and silently un-pruning it;
3. the block's *untrained* constants come from the student too, for the same
   reason -- ``test_the_blocks_other_constants_come_from_the_student`` is
   built so that getting this wrong reports a loss of exactly zero.

What is deliberately *not* claimed anywhere here: that this beats
:func:`onnxsim.apply_pruning_finetune`, the closed-form layer-wise fit that
already exists for pruning recovery. It does not, where that one applies; see
``apply_block_finetune``'s own docstring for the boundary.

Two limitations are pinned rather than left to be discovered. A calibration set
too small for the block's parameter count is fitted exactly and generalizes
almost not at all -- the loss falls three orders of magnitude either way, so
the loss cannot tell you which happened. And nothing masks the optimizer, so an
unstructured-pruned weight comes back fully dense. Both have a test, and the
second asserts the *current* behaviour rather than the desired one, so that
fixing it is a visible change.

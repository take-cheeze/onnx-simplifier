"""Qualcomm QNN execution-provider compatibility test.

Verifies that onnxsim's output still compiles and runs on the Qualcomm AI Runtime
(QNN) execution provider, and that simplification does not change the on-device
result. Uses the pip-installable ``onnxruntime-qnn`` wheel: on a plain x86-64
CPU host (no Snapdragon device) the bundled HTP backend does the full offline
graph compile and executes in the x86 emulator, so this runs on an ordinary CI
runner.

The whole module is skipped when ``onnxruntime-qnn`` is not installed (the
default test matrix does not pull it in), so it is safe to keep in ``tests/``.
The heavy, curated model sweep lives in ``scripts/qualcomm`` and runs on a
schedule; this file is the fast, in-tree smoke test.

# Integration/regression test: onnxsim against Kyutai's Pocket TTS
# (https://github.com/kyutai-labs/pocket-tts, "a TTS that fits in your CPU
# (and pocket)"), a small streaming-state text-to-speech model. The upstream
# checkpoints are gated, so this test targets the community ONNX export
# published at https://huggingface.co/KevinAHM/pocket-tts-onnx (exported by
# https://github.com/KevinAHM/pocket-tts-onnx-export from the real
# ``kyutai/pocket-tts`` weights), a public, non-gated mirror of the same
# graphs -- no HF auth needed to download.
#
# The bundle covers pocket-tts's whole pipeline and, between the five graphs,
# exercises the streaming/stateful patterns onnxsim needs to handle
# correctly:
#
#   * ``text_conditioner.onnx``  -- a single Gather-based token embedding.
#   * ``mimi_encoder.onnx``      -- audio -> latent Conv/Transformer encoder.
#   * ``flow_lm_flow.onnx``      -- the stateless flow-matching (Euler) step.
#   * ``mimi_decoder.onnx``      -- latent -> audio streaming decoder: a
#     Mod/ScatterND ring-buffer KV cache plus dozens of small Conv "previous
#     frame" states, several of them ``bool`` flags.
#   * ``flow_lm_main.onnx``      -- the transformer backbone: 18 KV-cache
#     state tensors per call, including a genuinely **static, zero-length**
#     dimension (``state_1``'s shape is ``(0,)``) used as an "empty so far"
#     sentinel -- not a symbolic/dynamic dim defaulting to 0, an exported
#     dim actually fixed at 0.
#
# That last detail is exactly what this test set was written to guard
# against: ``onnxsim.generate_random_calibration_data`` (via its internal
# ``_input_specs``) used to promote *any* non-positive ``dim_value`` to 1,
# conflating "genuinely fixed to 0" with "unset/symbolic" -- so calibrating
# or measuring accuracy drop on ``flow_lm_main.onnx``/``mimi_decoder.onnx``
# built a shape ONNX Runtime rejected outright, and that exception was
# silently swallowed by ``recommend_quantization``'s candidate loop, which
# reported a generic "no candidate quantization scheme both applied to this
# model and shrank it" instead of the real calibration failure. Fixed in
# ``onnxsim/calibration.py`` by checking ``dim.HasField("dim_value")``
# instead of ``dim.dim_value > 0`` (matching the pattern ``model_info.py``
# already used for the same ambiguity); see
# ``test_generate_random_calibration_data_keeps_static_zero_dim`` in
# ``test_static_quantize_matmul.py`` for the minimal unit-level regression
# test, and ``test_pocket_tts_flow_lm_main_quantize_weight_only`` below for
# end-to-end coverage on the real model that surfaced it.
#
# Two more things worth knowing if you're using this test set as a
# reference for quantizing similar exports:
#
#   * onnxsim's weight quantizers only recognize a MatMul/Gemm's weight
#     input when it is *directly* a graph initializer. The legacy
#     TorchScript ``torch.onnx.export`` path used by pocket-tts's exporter
#     emits each ``nn.Linear`` as ``MatMul(x, Transpose(weight))`` --
#     quantizing the raw export directly finds almost nothing to quantize.
#     Running ``onnxsim.simplify()`` first folds ``Transpose(initializer)``
#     into a plain pre-transposed initializer, which is what actually
#     exposes the real Linear weights to every ``quantize_*`` function.
#     Always simplify before quantizing.
#   * ``quantize_weight_only_int4`` needs ONNX opset 21 for the native INT4
#     tensor type and silently no-ops on pocket-tts's opset-14 export;
#     ``onnxsim.simplify(model, target_opset_version=21)`` upgrades it in
#     place before quantizing.
#
# Downloads real model weights (16-290MB per case, ~460MB total across all
# 5) over the network and, for flow_lm_main.onnx, takes well over a minute
# under check_n=3 -- too slow/network-dependent for every PR. It is opt-in
# via ONNXSIM_RUN_POCKET_TTS_TESTS=1, set by the dedicated weekly
# .github/workflows/pocket_tts.yml. To run it locally::

#     pip install --force-reinstall --no-deps .   # the onnxsim under test

"""A first empirical resource-model census across this project's entire
committed mcode fixture corpus (306 files, spanning Mul/Gemm/Conv/
MatMul/training-graph fixtures accumulated across this whole session's
decode work) -- groundwork for a future from-scratch mcode code
generator, not a decode of any specific op's semantics.

Every mcode-generation technique built so far (`scripts/axera/emitter.py`,
`scripts/axera/tiny_emit.py`'s `patch_*` functions) works by taking a
real Pulsar2-compiled reference and rewriting only specific known
scalar fields inside it -- the addressing/allocation itself (which
bank, which field offset, which register a piece of content lands in)
is always copied verbatim from the reference, never derived. A genuine
from-scratch generator (tinygrad-scheduler-backed or otherwise) would
need a resource model first: what banks exist, how many registers,
which look general-purpose versus op-specific. This file builds that
census empirically, for the first time, from the fixture corpus this
project already has on disk.

**Not the first field-map work in this project** -- `scripts/axera/README.md`'s
"`a1 00 xx yy` is a field write" section (~line 2206) already decoded
the same `a1 00 <field> <bank> <value>` mechanism from two full real
models (`resnet18d`, `mnasnet`), finding banks 1-4 as the primary ones
and ~68 distinct fields. This file is a *different, complementary*
dataset -- this session's own corpus of small, single-op probe
fixtures rather than full real models -- and mostly reconfirms that
earlier finding at far higher sample size (306 fixtures vs. 2 models),
while adding new banks/registers the original two-model sample never
saw.

## Method

`mcode.decode(data, **mcode.FULL_RULE)` on every fixture, aggregating:
`V`-kind (verb) records' `bank`/`field` pairs, and `S`/`B`-kind
(short-unit / bare-pair) records' `reg` values with their `tag`
distributions.

## Bank census: the 16-byte-granularity rule holds with zero
## exceptions across all 306 fixtures

Every one of the 306 fixtures decodes cleanly (`mcode.decode` raises on
none of them). Across every `V`-kind record found (tens of thousands),
**every single `field` value is an exact multiple of 16 -- zero
exceptions** -- confirming the README's own already-established rule
at roughly 10x the sample size it was originally checked against.

39 distinct banks appear in total, but usage is sharply bimodal:

- **A small "core" set is near-universal**: banks `0x00`-`0x04` (the
  README's own already-named primary banks) each appear in all 306
  fixtures with thousands of writes and up to 16 distinct fields.
  Banks `0x0e`, `0x0f`, `0x1c`, `0x1e` are *also* near-universal
  (305-306 of 306 fixtures) with hundreds to over a thousand writes
  each -- this project's earlier two-model sample never singled these
  out specifically as "core" banks the way it did 1-4; recorded here as
  a real, corpus-wide finding worth folding into that earlier picture,
  not decoded further (what these four banks' fields mean is not
  established here).
- **The other 20 of 39 banks are sparse** (originally 21 at the
  306-fixture corpus; PR #1568's 2 new bank-`0x81` carrier fixtures
  pushed that bank's own count from 8 to 10, crossing out of this
  bucket): seen in 9 or fewer fixtures
  each (most in 1-3), with small write counts. These read as genuinely
  op/shape-specific banks, not a general vocabulary -- but the sample
  per bank is too thin here to say anything about what any individual
  one does.

## Register census: a real 36-register "universal" set exists, but
## register *magnitude* does not predict it

247 distinct register numbers appear across the corpus.

- **36 registers are present in literally every one of the 306
  fixtures** -- `{0, 2, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28,
  32, 36, 38, 40, 52, 60, 62, 66, 72, 74, 76, 78, 96, 100, 101, 106,
  107, 120, 126, 128, 138}`. `reg=8` is by far the heaviest member
  (27,369 uses, 8 distinct tags dominated by tag `132`: 19,812 uses and
  tag `131`: 4,345) -- consistent with this project's earlier,
  narrower characterization of `reg=8` as hosting "a rotating generic
  short-unit payload" (the Gemm M=8 close, `tests/test_axera_gemm_m8_diff_is_allocation_noise.py`).
  This census shows `reg=8` is the extreme case of a real 36-register
  *set* with this property, not a special lone register.
- **A hypothesis checked directly, and only partly supported**: small
  register *numbers* do skew toward higher corpus-wide presence on
  average -- splitting all 247 registers at `reg<=0x40` vs. `reg>0x40`
  gives the small-number group a higher average presence (167.3 of 306
  fixtures) than the large-number group (100.5) -- but this is a weak
  correlation, not a clean split usable as a rule. The 36-register
  universal set itself spans both halves: `96, 100, 101, 106, 107, 120,
  126, 128, 138` are all `>0x40` yet appear in every single fixture,
  same as `reg=8` does. Register magnitude is not a reliable proxy for
  "general-purpose" on its own; what actually identifies the universal
  set is each register's own corpus-wide presence count, not its
  numeric value.
- **67 registers appear in 3 or fewer fixtures** -- genuinely sparse,
  almost entirely tagged `225` (`0xe1`) with only 2-6 total uses each.
  Too thin a sample to assign any of them a confident role; recorded
  as "sparse, op/shape-specific-looking, not characterized further."

## What this does not establish

This is a census, not a decode: it does not explain what any specific
bank's fields or any specific register's tag values *compute*, only
their distribution across the corpus. It does not distinguish real
per-op-program addressing structure from this project's own
already-documented allocator noise (register/bank assignment has been
independently confirmed non-deterministic across identical rebuilds in
several op families this session -- Gemm's M=8 lead, Gemm's `transB`
rotation, MatMul's `A_offset`/`B_offset` table-order coin flip); a
register or bank appearing in every fixture could still be assigned to
different *content* on different builds of the identical graph, which
this file does not check. It is a first, purely empirical map of what
exists and how often, not of what determines placement.

## A note on corpus-size fragility (fixed here)

This file originally pinned every aggregate to the exact fixture count
at the time it was written (306, then hand-bumped to 310, 318, 322 as
later PRs added fixtures). That turned out to be a real, recurring
maintenance problem, not a one-off: PR #1568 had to bump these counts,
PR #1570 had to bump them again (finding a *second* round of silent
drift that had happened in between with no test catching it), and PR
#1571 hit an actual git merge conflict against PR #1570's own count
bump -- both PRs independently "fixed" the same hardcoded numbers to
different, both slightly-stale values, resolved only by recomputing
the true numbers directly against the final combined fixture set
rather than trusting either side.

The fix applied here: assertions that exist to catch a *structural*
regression (a core bank stops appearing in every fixture; the register
space collapses to a handful) now compare against `_CENSUS["n_fixtures"]`
computed live, or use a ratio/threshold that scales with corpus size,
instead of a hardcoded absolute number. Assertions whose only content
*was* "how many fixtures exist right now" are loosened to floor
checks (the corpus should only grow) rather than deleted, so a
fixture accidentally going missing is still caught. The "sparse"
bucket's own boundary (previously the pinned constant `<=9` fixtures
for banks, `<=3` for registers) is now derived from the live fixture
count via a fixed *fraction* (3% for banks, 1% for registers -- chosen
to reproduce the exact same boundary, 9 and 3, at both the 306- and
322-fixture corpus sizes this project has already passed through), so
adding fixtures no longer requires touching this file at all unless a
genuinely new structural pattern emerges (a bank/register crossing a
bucket boundary is still visible in the *aggregate* counts these tests
check, just no longer as a hardcoded number that has to be hand-edited
in lockstep with every fixture-adding PR).

"""Integration test guarding onnxsim as a preprocessor for ONNX-Net-style tools.

ONNX-Net (arXiv:2510.04938) turns an ONNX graph into a text encoding for an
LLM-based architecture performance predictor. Its pipeline explicitly runs a
model through onnxsim first, then relies on two structural properties of the
*simplified* graph before it can serialize it cheaply:

  * "node removal" -- no-op scaffolding (e.g. ``Identity``) must already be
    gone, since such nodes carry no architectural information but would still
    consume a line of text.
  * "subgraph merging" -- common multi-node idioms with a known high-level
    interpretation, e.g. ``MatMul`` + bias ``Add``, must already be collapsed
    into the single node that names them (``Gemm``, i.e. a "linear layer" in
    the paper's own example), rather than left as separate primitive ops.

Those two properties in turn make the graph a plain, unbranching chain, which
is exactly what ONNX-Net's chain-condensation step needs: it merges any run
of nodes with no branching onto a single text line, and a graph that is
*already* one straight chain condenses to a single line for free.

This test does not depend on ONNX-Net's code (it lives in a separate
repository); it only pins down, from this repo's side, that onnxsim's output
still has the shape that pipeline assumes.

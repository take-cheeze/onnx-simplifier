"""Formal check for StaticQuantizeConv (opt-in; onnxsim's own
``onnxsim/passes/static_quantize_conv.h``): the Conv-layer sibling of
``static_quantize_matmul.h`` (``test_formal_verify_static_quantize_matmul.py``,
this file's direct template) -- same QDQ format, same calibrated asymmetric
activation quantization, same per-output-channel symmetric weight
quantization. It rewrites ``Y = Conv(X, W)`` (optional bias, a third input,
left completely untouched) -- ``W`` a constant FLOAT32 tensor, rank >= 3
(``[Cout, Cin/groups, k...]``), ``X`` FLOAT32 -- into QDQ format, leaving the
Conv node itself untouched and rewiring only its inputs::

    Xq  = QuantizeLinear(X, Xs, Xzp)          -- Xs/Xzp: CALIBRATED, fixed
    Xdq = DequantizeLinear(Xq, Xs, Xzp)
    Wdq = DequantizeLinear(Wq, Ws, Wzp, axis=0)    -- symmetric, Wzp spelled
    out explicitly (all zeros, same shape as Ws)
    Y   = Conv(Xdq, Wdq)

The ONE structural difference from the MatMul/Gemm version -- exactly the
same simplification ``weight_only_quantize_conv.h`` makes relative to its own
MatMul sibling: Conv's weight layout ``[Cout, Cin/groups, k...]`` ALWAYS puts
the output channel on axis 0, so unlike Gemm (whose ``transB`` attribute
picks between weight stored as ``[N, K]`` or ``[K, N]``) there is no
transposed-layout case here -- ``axis=0`` unconditionally. Every other
structural point below, including the shared calibration-range global
(``StaticQuantizationCalibrationRanges``, defined in
``static_quantize_matmul.h`` and included by this pass's own header), is
identical to the template file's own reasoning, restated in Conv's
vocabulary.

Soundness claim
================
Exactly like ``static_quantize_matmul``, and unlike ``weight_only_quantize_
conv`` (whose bound collapses to a single-operand special case, ``eps_x :=
0``, since ``X`` is never quantized there), this pass quantizes BOTH
operands -- ``quantized_mac_bound``'s own general two-operand shape, with
``eps_x := Xs / 2`` and ``eps_w := Ws[c] / 2`` both genuinely nonzero::

    |Conv(X, W)[..., c, ...] - Conv(Xdq, Wdq)[..., c, ...]| <=
        (Xs / 2) * sum_k |W[c, k]| + (Ws[c] / 2) * sum_k |X_patch[k]|
        + K * (Xs / 2) * (Ws[c] / 2)

Modeling Conv's actual windowed-sum/im2col semantics in Z3 is not needed, any
more than the MatMul version needed to model MatMul's own indexing beyond a
concrete contraction dimension: once a spatial output position and output
channel ``c`` are fixed, that one output element is exactly a dot product of
the receptive-field patch of ``X`` (``Cin/groups * prod(kernel dims)``
values, flattened) against ``W[c, ...]`` (flattened the same way) -- i.e.
precisely the "one output element is a linear combination of weight and
input values" shape ``quantized_mac_bound`` already models via a small
concrete contraction dimension ``_K``. So, exactly as in the MatMul template
file and in ``weight_only_quantize_conv``'s own analogous docstring, ``_K``
below stands in for that one output position's receptive-field-times-weight
contraction (``Cin/groups * prod(kernel dims)`` in a real Conv), not for
anything specific to convolution's sliding-window structure. The proof
reuses the MatMul template's exact Z3 formulation -- the direct-error-
variable (``ex``/``ew``) idiom, built from the start to avoid the known
nonlinear-blowup risk (see that file's own docstring for the investigation
that established this) -- with no changes needed to the vocabulary itself,
only to the surrounding prose.

Carrying the nonzero zero-point through the derivation
========================================================
As in the MatMul template, the per-element hypothesis the bound proof needs
is ``X``'s own round-trip bound, ``|X[i, k] - Xdq[i, k]| <= Xs / 2``. This
file reproves that round-trip lemma here, in its own ``Xs``/``Xzp``
vocabulary, with ``Xzp`` a genuinely free (and, in the differential tests
below, genuinely nonzero) variable -- the algebra shows exactly why the bound
doesn't care: dequantizing subtracts back out exactly the zero-point that
quantizing added, for ANY zero-point value, as long as nothing clips. That
"as long as nothing clips" matters -- the same explicit side condition
``test_formal_verify_quantize_round_trip.py`` calls out for its own lemma --
and, as in the MatMul template, the differential tests below calibrate from
the actual data range being tested (so nothing clips there) rather than
asserting it away.

No consumer-composition step is added here, matching this suite's usual
reasoning for a numeric *bound* (as opposed to an *equality*) claim: an
arbitrary consumer need not be Lipschitz, so a bound on
``|Conv(X, W) - Conv(Xdq, Wdq)|`` does not in general bound anything about
``|consumer(Conv(X, W)) - consumer(Conv(Xdq, Wdq))|``.

Invoking the pass with a specific calibrated range
====================================================
As the MatMul template file's own docstring explains in full: the actual
nanobind-exposed entry point ``onnxsim.onnxsim_cpp2py_export.quantize_static
(model_bytes, activation_ranges)`` takes a caller-supplied ``{tensor name:
(min, max)}`` dict directly and runs ``OptimizeFixed`` with exactly
``["static_quantize_matmul", "static_quantize_conv"]`` -- i.e. it already
isolates this pass family (confirmed here to include ``static_quantize_
conv`` via ``onnxsim.onnxsim_cpp2py_export._list_other_optimizers()``) with
no extra ``skipped_optimizers``/``simplify_isolated_extra`` machinery, and
applies the rewrite with no shape inference or other simplification
alongside it. The differential tests below call it directly, exactly like
the MatMul template does, and check the proved bound directly against
onnxruntime's own execution of the rewritten graph rather than onnxsim's own
random-input equivalence check.

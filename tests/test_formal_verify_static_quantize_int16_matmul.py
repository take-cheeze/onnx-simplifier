"""Formal check for StaticQuantizeInt16MatMul (opt-in; onnxsim's own
``onnxsim/passes/static_quantize_int16_matmul.h``): the "W8A16" sibling of
``static_quantize_matmul.h`` (this file's primary template --
``test_formal_verify_static_quantize_matmul.py`` -- already proves the exact
QDQ-format bound for that UINT8-activation pass; read it in full first). The
weight stays INT8, quantized per output channel, symmetric, via the exact
same ``QuantizeWeightPerChannelInPlace`` call the UINT8 pass uses -- nothing
about the weight scheme changes here. The only difference is the
*activation*: instead of ``ComputeAsymmetricUint8QuantParams`` (scale divisor
255), this pass calls ``ComputeAsymmetricUint16QuantParams`` (scale divisor
65535), an 8x finer calibrated affine step aimed at activations unusually
sensitive to the QuantizeLinear/DequantizeLinear round trip (e.g. post-
softmax attention scores). It also requires opset >= 21 (UINT16
QuantizeLinear/DequantizeLinear support), unlike the UINT8 pass's opset >= 13.

Is the bound proof genuinely new Z3 content, or a re-instantiation?
====================================================================
``static_quantize_matmul``'s own ``_bound_formulas`` helper (and this file's
copy of it, below) builds ``quantized_mac_bound``'s general two-operand lemma
purely from a free per-tap scale variable ``Xs`` and a per-tap rounding
hypothesis ``|ex[k]| <= Xs / 2`` -- the proof's hypotheses never mention 255,
65535, or any other concrete divisor; the divisor only ever enters where a
concrete scale ``Xs`` is *computed* from a calibrated range, which happens on
the C++ side (``ComputeAsymmetricUint16QuantParams``) and in this file's own
differential tests (``_expected_asymmetric_uint16_quant_params`` below), not
inside the bound lemma's Z3 vocabulary itself. So the bound-proving queries
below are mechanically identical to the UINT8 file's -- this is confirmed,
not assumed, precisely because ``_bound_formulas`` here is copied verbatim
and still closes with the same hypotheses. What line up differently is:

1. ``static_quantize_int16_matmul``-specific declination behavior (opset >=
   21 rather than >= 13) -- tested structurally against the real pass below,
   including the concrete case where the UINT8 pass would fire (opset 13)
   but this one still declines.
2. A genuinely new corollary, absent from the UINT8 file entirely: for the
   SAME calibrated range, this pass's UINT16 activation scale is *exactly*
   1/257 of what the UINT8 pass's scale would be for that same range --
   ``255 * 257 == 65535`` exactly, so ``Xs_8 == 257 * Xs_16`` is not an
   approximation but an exact integer identity (``test_static_quantize_
   int16_matmul_activation_scale_is_257x_finer_than_uint8`` below). Since the
   bound's activation-error term is ``eps_x * sum|W|`` with ``eps_x = Xs /
   2``, this directly shows that term is 257x smaller here, all else equal
   -- the concrete payoff of "W8A16" over "W8A8" for the activand fed
   through the standard analysis.

Both scale formulas apply the identical widening step first (``lo = min(0,
min_val)``, ``hi = max(0, max_val)``) before dividing by their respective
divisor, so the corollary below works directly with that shared, already-
widened ``(lo, hi)`` pair rather than re-deriving the widening itself (which
neither differs between, nor is specific to, either pass).

Everything else -- the direct-error-variable (``ex``/``ew``) idiom, ``_K =
2``, the round-trip lemma carrying a free zero-point, the Gemm "+ Bias"
cancellation, the vacuity negative control -- mirrors the UINT8 file exactly;
see it for the fuller exposition of each. As that file's own docstring notes
(re-emphasized in ``test_formal_verify_dynamic_quantize_matmul.py``'s
incident writeup), every bound-proving query here is built from the start in
the direct-error-variable idiom -- never reconstructed from separate
quantized-code/zero-point multiplicands -- which is what keeps these queries
fast (~20-25s) instead of hanging.

Invoking the pass with a specific calibrated range
====================================================
Exactly mirroring the UINT8 file's own reasoning: the nanobind-exposed entry
point one layer under ``onnxsim.calibration.quantize_static_int16`` is
``onnxsim.onnxsim_cpp2py_export.quantize_static_int16(model_bytes,
activation_ranges)`` (see ``onnxsim/cpp2py_export.cc``) -- the exact
analogue of ``quantize_static`` the UINT8 file's own differential tests use,
just calling ``QuantizeStaticInt16`` (``onnxsim/quantize_entry.cpp``), which
runs ``OptimizeFixed`` with exactly ``["static_quantize_int16_matmul",
"static_quantize_int16_conv"]``. This already isolates this pass family with
no ``extra_optimizers``/``simplify_isolated_extra`` machinery needed, and
takes a caller-supplied ``{name: (min, max)}`` dict directly rather than
requiring calibration *data* to be fabricated -- so no dedicated "isolate
just this one pass" helper needed to be discovered or improvised; it already
existed, symmetric with the UINT8 pass's own.

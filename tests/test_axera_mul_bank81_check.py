"""Continues `tests/test_axera_bank81_cross_op_check.py` (PR #1608)'s own
generalization pattern: that file found Gemm's ENTIRE `bank=0x81`/`0xe1`
mutual-exclusivity mechanism (the `1024//K-1` formula, the `N=32/33`
boundary, field=144, and more) is not Gemm-specific -- it's a property of
"a matmul-like op with one live tensor and one compile-time-constant
weight matrix," reproduced byte-for-byte by a constant-weight
`MatMul(x, w)`. Every existing MatMul/Mul fixture in this corpus uses TWO
live tensors (the precondition for the `A_offset`/`B_offset`-style
table-order coin flip), so the mechanism never showed up in the routine
probe corpus for either op until PR #1608 built a constant-weight MatMul
on purpose. This file does the same for **Mul**, completing the four-op
picture (Gemm: yes; Conv: no, PR #1608; MatMul-with-constant-weight: yes,
PR #1608; Mul-with-constant-operand: this file).

## A bonus finding along the way: some ALREADY-COMMITTED, ordinary
## two-live-tensor `Mul[1,8]` fixtures already carry bank `0xe1`

Before building anything new, scanning every already-committed
`mul_*.mcode.gz` fixture (26 total) for bank `0x81`/`0xe1` finds bank
`0x81` nowhere, but bank `0xe1` in 11 of them (`mul_1x8_zp25sweep`,
`mul_1x8_universal_stability_r{3,4,6}`, `mul_1x8_w2`, four more
`zp*sweep` variants) -- and the operand is `tests/test_axera_matmul_bank_0xe1_check.py`
(PR #1604)'s own "MatMul-specific" pair (`field=32` operand `09 03 00`,
`field=48` operand `0b 03 00 a1`), NOT the Gemm-matching pair. This is a
new cross-op sighting of PR #1604's own second pair at a tiny,
completely ordinary Mul shape with two live tensors -- no constant
operand needed for THIS pair, unlike the Gemm-matching one this file
goes on to chase. Not decoded further here (which of the 26 fixtures
carry it, and why only some, is a separate question from this file's
own constant-operand focus).

## Building `Mul(x, c)`, `c` a compile-time-constant `[K,N]` initializer

Mirroring PR #1608's own constant-weight MatMul construction (a
standalone build script bypassing `pulsar2_docker.py`'s single-image-
classifier config helper with a hand-written `Numpy`-calibration config,
matching `scripts/axera/calib_search.py`'s own established pattern; a
pre-built `onnxsim_cpp2py_export.abi3.so` + `version.py` borrowed from a
sibling checkout into this worktree's `onnxsim/` package at build time,
neither committed -- confirmed gitignored), 9 shapes were built at
`(batch, K, N)` element counts spanning from well below Gemm's own
`K*N<=32768`-ish cap to nearly 8.4 million elements.

## Result: bank `0x81` NEVER appears for Mul, even at the largest shape
## tested -- but bank `0xe1`'s Gemm-matching field=32/48 pair DOES, at a
## much higher threshold than Gemm's own

| shape (`K`,`N`) | `K*N` | bank `0x81` | bank `0xe1` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 512, 16 | 8,192 | absent | absent |
| 512, 64 | 32,768 (Gemm's own cap, exactly) | absent | absent |
| 512, 65 | 33,280 | absent | absent |
| 512, 200 | 102,400 | absent | field=32/48/64 present |
| 512, 500 | 256,000 | absent | field=32/48/64 present |
| 512, 1000 | 512,000 | absent | field=32/48/64 present |
| 512, 4096 | 2,097,152 | absent | field=32/48 present (no field=64) |
| 2048, 4096 | 8,388,608 | absent | field=32/48 present, plus ~60 field=240 records |

**Bank `0x81` is a clean, confident negative across this entire range** --
zero instances at any shape, including the largest (`K=2048,N=4096`,
over 250x Gemm's own `N=33` trigger point in raw element count). This is
consistent with `0x81`'s own mechanism (the `1024//K-1` formula, keyed
on a real matrix-multiply CONTRACTION dimension `K`) being specific to
ops that actually contract over a shared dimension -- Mul is purely
elementwise, with no `K`-summation at all, so there is no dimension for
`0x81`'s own formula to apply to even in principle. This is a genuine,
informative structural boundary, not just an untested gap: bank `0x81`'s
own mechanism does not generalize to elementwise ops.

**Bank `0xe1`'s Gemm-matching field=32/48 pair (`33 03 00` / `35 03 00
[a1]`) DOES appear for Mul, confirming it generalizes across ALL FOUR
main ops now** (Gemm, Conv `tests/test_axera_conv_dilation8_length_growth.py`
PR #1602, MatMul `tests/test_axera_matmul_bank_0xe1_check.py` PR #1604,
and now Mul) -- but Mul's own threshold sits far above Gemm's own
`K*N<=32768` cap: absent at `K*N=33,280` (`K=512,N=65`), present at
`K*N=102,400` (`K=512,N=200`). The exact crossing point between those
two is not bisected further here. This matches this session's own
repeated finding (`tests/test_axera_gemm_e1_periodicity_check.py`
PR #1609, `tests/test_axera_matmul_gemm_pair_trigger_search.py` PR #1607)
that this pair's VALUES are shared codec-wide while its TRIGGER
mechanism is genuinely different per op -- Mul is simply a fourth,
distinct trigger, not reducible to any of the other three.

## Two honest wrinkles, flagged rather than forced

1. **Field=48's own operand form is not fixed.** At `K=512,N=200/500/1000`
   it's a 3-byte `35 03 00` (missing the trailing `a1` every other op's
   version has); at `K=512,N=4096` it grows to the full 4-byte
   `35 03 00 a1`, matching Gemm/Conv/MatMul exactly. The exact `N` where
   this form changes (somewhere between 1000 and 4096) is not pinned
   down here.
2. **An extra field=64 record** (`37 83 1c 01`) accompanies the pair at
   `K=512,N=200/500/1000` but disappears by `N=4096`, and a much larger
   family of ~60 field=240 records (a repeating tiling-like pattern,
   values like `b5 07 00`/`b5 01 00 a1`/`b3 07 00`) appears only at the
   largest shape (`K=2048,N=4096`) -- plausibly scheduling/tiling
   overhead specific to a shape this much larger, not decoded further.

**Content-stable across independent rebuilds**: two independently-seeded
`(K=512,N=1000)` builds show byte-identical bank `0x81`/`0xe1` content --
real compiled content, not per-build allocator noise.

## What this completes

The four-op picture for Gemm's own `0x81`/`0xe1` mutual-exclusivity
mechanism is now closed: Gemm (native), MatMul-with-constant-weight
(full reproduction, PR #1608), Conv (neither bank at any shape tested,
PR #1608), and Mul-with-constant-operand (this file: `0xe1`'s shared
sub-content only, `0x81` a clean negative). The overall shape of the
finding -- a shared vocabulary of constant VALUES with per-op-family
TRIGGER mechanisms, and one bank (`0x81`) whose mechanism needs a real
contraction dimension elementwise ops simply do not have -- is
consistent across everything this session's own cross-op `0x81`/`0xe1`
investigation has found.

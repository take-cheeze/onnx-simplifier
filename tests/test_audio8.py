# Integration/regression test: onnxsim against real ONNX exports from the
# Audio8 org on Hugging Face (https://huggingface.co/Audio8), a set of
# permissively-licensed TTS/ASR audio models shipped with ONNX Runtime
# deployment packages. This guards against onnxsim regressions on the kind of
# LLM-style, KV-cache-carrying, quantized graphs those packages ship:
# ``com.microsoft`` weight-only INT4 ops (``MatMulNBits``,
# ``GatherBlockQuantized``), ORT dynamic-quantization QOperator ops
# (``DynamicQuantizeLinear``/``MatMulInteger``), fp16 Conv/ConvTranspose
# codec stacks, and autoregressive decoder graphs with 8-16 parallel KV-cache
# input/output pairs.
#
# One real onnxsim bug was found and fixed via this model set:
# ``fast_ar_int4.onnx``'s attention blocks simplify to a model that fails to
# load in onnxruntime with "Invalid tensor data type 0". Root cause: onnx's
# Graph-native shape inference (``onnx::InferShapesOnGraph``) left a handful
# of Reshape-output ``value_info`` entries with a shape but no resolved
# element type (``elem_type == UNDEFINED``); ``onnx.checker.check_model``
# tolerates that malformed TypeProto, but onnxruntime's model loader does
# not. See ``DropIncompleteValueInfo`` in onnxsim.cpp, which strips such
# entries (value_info is optional annotation; dropping an incomplete entry
# cannot change model semantics) -- this test's ``fast_ar_int4.onnx`` case
# guards against that regressing.
#
# Downloads real model weights (10-290MB per case, ~450MB total across all 6)
# from Hugging Face and, for the larger TTS models, takes over a minute per
# model under check_n=3 -- too slow/network-dependent for every PR. The
# quantization-quality tests further down this file download their own
# fp32/int8 pairs -- one from the Audio8 ASR package (~520MB more), one from
# the 0.1B TTS package (~37MB) -- for the same reason. It is opt-in via
# ONNXSIM_RUN_AUDIO8_TESTS=1, set by the dedicated weekly
# .github/workflows/audio8.yml. To run it locally::

    Used only because Audio8 never published an fp32 ONNX export of its
    0.1B TTS model (unlike the ASR package above, which ships fp32 and
    INT8 side by side) -- this is the only way to get *any* float
    reference for it. For each ``MatMulInteger`` node whose weight is a
    static, per-channel-symmetric INT8 initializer named ``<x>_quantized``
    with sibling ``<x>_scale``/``<x>_zero_point`` initializers (the naming
    ONNX Runtime's own quantizer emits, which is what produced this
    export), it dequantizes the weight back to float32 and rewrites the
    node that produced the dequantized-matmul's final output, in place, as
    a plain ``MatMul(X_float, W_dequant)`` -- ``X_float`` being the
    ``DynamicQuantizeLinear`` node's own original float input, not a
    round-tripped quantize/dequantize of it. This removes the published
    export's activation-quantization noise entirely and leaves only the
    weight-quantization error already baked into the published INT8
    weights, a much closer stand-in for the model's actual fp32 weights
    than any alternative available here (there is no PyTorch-to-ONNX
    exporter for this model's custom per-token recurrent contract in this
    repository or upstream).

    Every other node in the graph (attention, RoPE, Mamba state, KV-cache
    handling, ...) is untouched; the now-dead ``DynamicQuantizeLinear``/
    ``MatMulInteger``/``Cast`` nodes upstream of each rewritten node are
    left in place for :func:`onnxsim.simplify` to prune afterward, rather
    than unlinked here, since a ``DynamicQuantizeLinear``'s three outputs
    are sometimes shared by more than one ``MatMulInteger`` consumer.

    :returns: ``(model, num_rewritten, num_skipped)``. A node is *skipped*
        (left as int8, not touched) if it doesn't match the exact pattern
        above -- the caller should require ``num_skipped == 0`` before
        trusting the result as a float reference, since a silently-skipped

    """Same comparison as
    :func:`test_audio8_quantize_dynamic_matches_published_int8_quality`
    above, for Audio8's 0.1B TTS model instead of the ASR one -- but
    Audio8 never published an fp32 ONNX export of it (only
    ``audio8-TTS-0.1B-ONNX-INT8``'s INT8 graphs exist), so there is no
    downloadable fp32 file to use as ground truth. The fp32 reference here
    is instead reconstructed by dequantizing this exact file's own INT8
    weights (:func:`_dequantize_dynamically_quantized_matmuls`), which
    also makes this the harder-edged variant of the two tests: since
    onnxsim's weight quantization is a lossless round-trip of weights that
    are *already* exact multiples of a per-channel scale (as these are,
    having been dequantized from int8), and DynamicQuantizeLinear is the
    same standard ONNX op either quantizer used, onnxsim's own
    quantize_dynamic is expected to land numerically identical (not just
    "close") to Audio8's own published INT8 export here -- confirmed
    locally at parity to ~1e-16 relative difference between the two
    reports' worst_relative_l2. The tolerance below stays generous rather
    than asserting exact equality so the test isn't fragile to floating-
    point non-associativity across platforms/BLAS backends.

"""AMD MIGraphX execution-provider compatibility test.

Verifies that onnxsim's output still compiles and runs on AMD's MIGraphX
execution provider, and that simplification does not change the on-device
result. Uses the pip-installable ``onnxruntime-migraphx`` wheel. Unlike the
Core ML / OpenVINO checks, MIGraphX has no CPU fallback or emulator -- it
needs a real ROCm-capable AMD GPU, so this module is skipped on every
ordinary CI runner and only runs where that hardware is present.

The whole module is skipped when the MIGraphX EP isn't usable (package
missing, or no ROCm device answers), so it is safe to keep in ``tests/``. The
heavier, curated model sweep lives in ``scripts/amd`` and is meant to run on
a self-hosted ROCm runner; this file is the fast, in-tree smoke test for that
same hardware.

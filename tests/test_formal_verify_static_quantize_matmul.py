"""Formal check for StaticQuantizeMatMul (opt-in; onnxsim's own
``onnxsim/passes/static_quantize_matmul.h``): the calibration-based sibling
of ``dynamic_quantize_matmul.h``
(``test_formal_verify_dynamic_quantize_matmul.py`` is this file's closest
template for the overall Z3-vocabulary shape) and
``weight_only_quantize_matmul.h``. It rewrites ``Y = MatMul(X, W)`` (or a
"vanilla" ``Gemm``, bias left untouched) -- ``W`` a constant 2-D FLOAT32
tensor, ``X`` FLOAT32 -- into QDQ ("quantize/dequantize") format, leaving the
MatMul/Gemm node itself untouched and rewiring only its inputs::

    Xq  = QuantizeLinear(X, Xs, Xzp)          -- Xs/Xzp: CALIBRATED, fixed
    Xdq = DequantizeLinear(Xq, Xs, Xzp)
    Wdq = DequantizeLinear(Wq, Ws, Wzp, axis=<channel_axis>)   -- symmetric,
    Wzp spelled out explicitly (all zeros, same shape as Ws)
    Y   = MatMul(Xdq, Wdq)

``Wq``/``Ws`` are the same per-output-channel symmetric INT8 weight
quantization every sibling pass in this family uses
(``QuantizeWeightPerChannelInPlace``). The genuinely new wrinkle here --
absent from every other pass this suite has proved so far, all of which use
a *symmetric* (``zero_point = 0``) scheme -- is ``Xs``/``Xzp``: the
activation's scale and zero-point are a *calibrated*, fixed ``(min, max)``
range (supplied by the caller, e.g. via ``onnxsim.calibration.quantize_static``
running representative data through the float model), quantized
*asymmetrically* to UINT8 via ``ComputeAsymmetricUint8QuantParams``:

    lo    = min(0, min_val)         hi = max(0, max_val)   # widened to include 0
    scale = (hi - lo) / 255
    zero_point = clamp(round(-lo / scale), 0, 255)

Widening the calibrated range to always include 0 (so a zero activation is
exactly representable) is what makes ``zero_point`` genuinely nonzero in
general -- e.g. a post-ReLU-like one-sided range ``[2, 10]`` still gets
``lo = 0`` (no shift needed), but an range like ``[-5, 10]`` that already
straddles 0 gives ``zero_point = round(5 / scale) = 85 != 0``. Every prior
pass in this family (``dynamic_quantize_matmul``, ``weight_only_quantize_
matmul``) only ever has ``zero_point = 0`` (dynamic quantization's own
``DynamicQuantizeLinear`` *does* compute an asymmetric zero-point at
runtime, but that pass's own proof deliberately works with its per-tap error
variables directly, never a literal zero-point term -- see below for why
this file does carry one explicitly).

Soundness claim
================
Unlike ``weight_only_quantize_matmul`` (whose bound collapses to a
single-operand special case, ``eps_x := 0``, since ``X`` is never quantized
there), this pass quantizes BOTH operands -- exactly ``quantized_mac_bound``'s
own general two-operand shape, with ``eps_x := Xs / 2`` and
``eps_w := Ws[n] / 2`` both genuinely nonzero::

    |MatMul(X, W)[i, n] - MatMul(Xdq, Wdq)[i, n]| <=
        (Xs / 2) * sum_k |W[k, n]| + (Ws[n] / 2) * sum_k |X[i, k]|
        + K * (Xs / 2) * (Ws[n] / 2)

This is actually a MORE direct instance of ``quantized_mac_bound``'s lemma
than ``dynamic_quantize_matmul``'s own proof is: that pass's literal node
chain computes ``Cast<float>(Acc) * (Xs * Ws)`` (an integer accumulator
rescaled after the fact), so its proof needs a separate ring-identity lemma
connecting that node chain to the elementwise-dequantized dot product before
the bound lemma even applies. Here, ``Y = MatMul(Xdq, Wdq)`` -- the pass's
own literal node chain -- computes the elementwise-dequantized dot product
directly, with no separate integer accumulator/rescale step, so
``quantized_mac_bound``'s bound lemma applies to the pass's actual output
with no intermediate identity lemma needed at all. The proof below is
therefore a direct, self-contained (own Z3 vocabulary, per this suite's
convention) instantiation of that already-proved lemma at a concrete
``_K = 2`` (matching ``quantized_mac_bound``'s and ``dynamic_quantize_
matmul``'s own choice -- enough to exercise the cross-tap sum, and this
shape of nonlinear query was already shown, in ``dynamic_quantize_matmul``'s
own investigation, to blow up well past 60s at ``_K`` this small if the
formulation is wrong), built from the start in the direct-error-variable
(``ex``/``ew``) idiom ``quantized_mac_bound`` itself uses -- not the
Xq/Xzp/Wq-multiplicand shape ``dynamic_quantize_matmul``'s FIRST (buggy,
since-fixed) attempt used, which is exactly what caused that blowup there.

Carrying the nonzero zero-point through the derivation
========================================================
The per-element hypothesis the bound proof above needs is ``X``'s own
round-trip bound, ``|X[i, k] - Xdq[i, k]| <= Xs / 2``. This is
``test_formal_verify_quantize_round_trip.py``'s own lemma (which is already
zero-point-generic there -- its proof shows ``zero_point`` cancels exactly
regardless of value), but since every OTHER pass in this file family only
ever instantiates it at ``zero_point = 0``, this file reproves it here, in
its own ``Xs``/``Xzp`` vocabulary, with ``Xzp`` a genuinely free (and, in the
differential tests below, genuinely nonzero) variable -- so this proof
actually carries a nonzero zero-point term through its own derivation rather
than assuming the symmetric case away. The algebra shows exactly why the
bound doesn't care: dequantizing subtracts back out exactly the zero-point
that quantizing added, for ANY zero-point value, as long as nothing clips.

That "as long as nothing clips" matters: ``QuantizeLinear``'s round-trip
bound of ``scale / 2`` holds only while the true value's quantized code
lands inside UINT8's ``[0, 255]`` range without being clamped -- a real
value outside the calibrated ``[min, max]`` range (calibration data that
doesn't cover the actual data seen at inference) CAN clip, and clipping can
introduce unbounded error (the same explicit side condition
``test_formal_verify_quantize_round_trip.py`` calls out for its own lemma).
This file's round-trip lemma below states "no clipping" as an explicit
hypothesis rather than silently assuming it, and the differential tests
calibrate from the actual data range being tested (so nothing clips there
either) rather than asserting it away.

No consumer-composition step is added here, matching this suite's usual
reasoning for a numeric *bound* (as opposed to an *equality*) claim: an
arbitrary consumer need not be Lipschitz, so a bound on
``|MatMul(X, W) - MatMul(Xdq, Wdq)|`` does not in general bound anything
about ``|consumer(MatMul(X, W)) - consumer(MatMul(Xdq, Wdq))|``.
``quantized_mac_bound``, ``dynamic_quantize_matmul`` and
``weight_only_quantize_matmul`` all skip this step for the same reason.

Invoking the pass with a specific calibrated range
====================================================
The typical end-user entry point, ``onnxsim.calibration.quantize_static``,
derives the calibration range itself by running representative
``calibration_data`` through the float model -- there is no argument letting
a caller hand it a specific, exact ``(min, max)`` per tensor directly. One
layer down, though, is the actual nanobind-exposed entry point that function
calls: ``onnxsim.onnxsim_cpp2py_export.quantize_static(model_bytes,
activation_ranges)``, where ``activation_ranges`` is precisely a ``{tensor
name: (min, max)}`` dict -- exactly the calibrated-range shape
``StaticQuantizationCalibrationRanges()`` (this pass's own C++ global,
overwritten by this call) stores. This is more direct and deterministic for
a small test than fabricating calibration *data* that happens to produce a
desired range, so the differential tests below call it directly. It runs
``OptimizeFixed`` with exactly ``["static_quantize_matmul",
"static_quantize_conv"]`` -- i.e. it already isolates this pass family
without any extra ``skipped_optimizers``/``simplify_isolated_extra``
machinery, and, unlike ``onnxsim.simplify``, applies the rewrite with no
shape inference or other simplification alongside it, so this suite's usual
``simplify_isolated_extra``/``check_n=0`` pattern isn't used here -- there is
no ``onnxsim.simplify`` random-input equivalence check to run in the first
place. The differential numeric-bound test instead checks the proved bound
directly against onnxruntime's own execution of the rewritten graph.

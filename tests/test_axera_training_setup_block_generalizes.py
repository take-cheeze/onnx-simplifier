"""The 35-record "setup sequence" this session decoded for Conv's `k=9`
kernel-orientation regime (`tests/test_axera_conv_k9_segment34_content.py`,
PR #1550) and then found recurring in a training-graph fixture
(`tests/test_axera_training_graph_setup_sequence.py`, PR #1552) is not a
two-fixture coincidence: it is a universal per-op-program preamble,
confirmed present in every committed training/backward-graph fixture
this project has, with one precisely-characterized variant.

## Method

`mcode.decode()` on each fixture's `segments()`, restricted to `V`-kind
(verb) records, compared as `(verb, field, bank)` triples against the
35-record `SHARED_SETUP_BLOCK` (copied verbatim from PR #1552, not
re-derived) -- a subsequence search, not a raw-byte search, the
technique this project's own record-level work has repeatedly found
necessary once byte offsets stop being comparable across differently-
shaped streams.

## Result: present in every fixture checked, exact in three, +1-record
## variant in the two full multi-op training steps

| fixture | segment | exact 35-match | notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `loss_head_kd.mcode.gz` | 4 | record 3 | exact |
| `resnet18_int8.mcode.gz` | 4 | record 4 | exact |
| `reshape_gather_bwd.mcode.gz` | 4 | record 3 | exact |
| `toy_training_step.mcode.gz` | 4 | -- | 36-record variant (below) |
| `w2v2fe_training_step.mcode.gz` | 4 | -- | 36-record variant (below) |

Combined with PR #1552's own `adam_update_fp32.mcode.gz` result, this
is **6 of 6** committed training/backward-graph fixtures -- every one
this project has -- carrying the block in segment 4 specifically, in
either the exact or the variant form. This is a much stronger claim
than PR #1552's own "not Conv-specific" framing supported: it is not
just cross-op-family, it is present in the *entire* training-graph
fixture corpus.

## The two full multi-op training steps carry a +1-record variant, not
## a divergence

`loss_head_kd`, `resnet18_int8`, and `reshape_gather_bwd` are each a
single op (or a short op-and-consumer pair). `toy_training_step` (24 op
programs, forward+KD-loss+backward+Adam chained in one compiled model,
per the README's "Training-graph streams" section) and
`w2v2fe_training_step` (a larger real training step) are both full,
multi-op-program training steps -- and in both, the setup block is not
simply absent or corrupted: it is the *identical* 35-record sequence
with exactly **one extra record, `(167, 0, 30)`, inserted between the
block's 22nd and 23rd elements** (i.e. right after the `(161, 48, 3)`
record that starts the block's third bank-run and before the `(168,
64, 3)` record that follows it). Confirmed record-for-record: the
first 22 records match `SHARED_SETUP_BLOCK[0:22]` exactly, the
insertion is `(167, 0, 30)` in both fixtures, and the remaining 13
records match `SHARED_SETUP_BLOCK[22:35]` exactly, shifted by one.

Verb `167` does not otherwise appear anywhere in `SHARED_SETUP_BLOCK`
itself. A plausible (not proven) reading, offered as a hypothesis: this
extra record marks something specific to being one of several chained
op-programs in a single compiled stream -- a sequencing or "next
program" marker -- present only in the two fixtures that are actually
multi-op training *steps* rather than single-op probes. Not decoded to
that meaning here; only the exact insertion point and content are
established.

## What remains open

This file locates the block precisely in every fixture and
characterizes its one real variant, but does not decode what the block
itself computes (still open per PR #1550/#1552), nor why the
insertion happens specifically at this position, nor whether it
correlates with op count, op type, or something else about multi-program
streams (only 2 data points, both multi-op streams, both showing the
identical insertion -- not enough to rule out "always exactly this" vs.
"varies with something not yet tested").

"""The Python half of the Python<->C++ step-graph emitter parity check.

``onnxsim/qat_graph_builder.{h,cpp}`` re-implements the emitter half of
:mod:`onnxsim.qat_graph` in C++, so the browser converter can build a training
step graph without a Python round trip. Two implementations of one emitter that
quietly disagree is the whole hazard of having done that: both graphs would be
valid, both would run, and the browser would train a model differently from the
Python with nothing saying so.

``onnxsim/qat_parity_fixtures.txt`` is the shared reference both sides are
measured against. This file asserts *fixture == Python*; the C++
``qat_graph_parity_test`` asserts *fixture == C++*. Together they give
Python == C++, which is the property actually wanted and which neither test
establishes on its own.

The failure this file exists to catch is specifically **a stale fixture**. The
C++ test alone cannot distinguish "the port is correct" from "the port matches
a fixture that stopped describing the Python three commits ago" -- in the
second case the C++ test still passes, cheerfully, while the two emitters have
diverged. So changing :mod:`onnxsim.qat_graph`'s emission without regenerating
must fail *here*, loudly, with instructions.

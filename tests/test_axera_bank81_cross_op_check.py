"""Checks whether Gemm's sparse bank `0x81` -- the mutually-exclusive

-- ALSO generalizes to Conv and MatMul, or is a Gemm-specific bank.

Gemm's own already-decoded content for this pair
(`tests/test_axera_gemm_sparse_bank_n_boundary.py` PR #1568,
`tests/test_axera_gemm_bank_81_e1_decode.py` PR #1570), at fixed
`M=1`:

- Bank `0x81` field=192's third operand byte is `1024 // K - 1`.
- Bank `0x81`/`0xe1` are mutually exclusive: `N<=32` uses `0xe1` alone,
  `N>=33` switches to `0x81` alone (the boundary sits exactly between
  32 and 33).
- Bank `0xe1` field=112 is a constant `35 81 1a` at every small-`N`
  shape tested.
- At large `N` (`N>=100`), `0xe1`'s own field=32/48 pair (the part that
  DOES already generalize across ops) coexists alongside `0x81`.
- Bank `0x81` field=144 (`08 03 00 a1`) appears at *some* large-`N`
  shapes and not others, unexplained (`tests/test_axera_gemm_field144_puzzle.py`
  PR #1573, `tests/test_axera_gemm_field144_q_rule.py` PR #1575).

## First pass: the existing 148 MatMul + 140 Conv fixtures in this
## corpus never carry bank `0x81` at all

Scanning every already-committed MatMul and Conv fixture in this
corpus (no new builds needed for this check) finds **zero** instances
of bank `0x81` in either op -- consistent with PR #1604's own
observation that MatMul's OTHER analogous banks (`0xe1`) needed a
specific shape trigger, not present in most of the corpus's own
routine probe shapes.

## The real reason: every existing MatMul fixture has TWO live tensors
## (`A`, `B`), not Gemm's own one-live-tensor-plus-constant-weight setup

Every MatMul fixture already in this corpus is built the way
`tests/test_axera_matmul_offset_table_coinflip.py` and its many
descendants always have: both `A` and `B` are live, non-constant graph
inputs (the precondition for the `A_offset`/`B_offset` table-order coin
flip this project has repeatedly relied on). Gemm's own bank `0x81`/
`0xe1` decode, by contrast, was always built with `B`/`C` forced to
compile-time constants (Pulsar2's own established behavior for `Gemm`)
-- a structurally different graph shape that no existing MatMul fixture
in this corpus actually has.

## Building a Gemm-equivalent MatMul (constant weight, single live
## tensor) recovers Gemm's ENTIRE `0x81`/`0xe1` mechanism, exactly

`MatMul(x, w)` with `w` a compile-time-constant `[K, N]` initializer
(the closest possible MatMul analogue of Gemm's own `B`) reproduces
every one of Gemm's own decoded findings, at the identical `N=32/33`
boundary and the identical `1024 // K - 1` formula:

| shape (`M=1`) | bank `0x81` field=192 | `1024//K-1` | bank `0xe1` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `K=512, N=16` | absent | -- | field=112 `\\x0d\\x81\\x1a` |
| `K=512, N=32` | absent | -- | field=112 `\\x35\\x81\\x1a` (**matches Gemm's own constant exactly**) |
| `K=512, N=33` | present, `01` | 1 | absent |
| `K=512, N=1000` | present, `01` (x2) + field=144 | 1 | field=32/48 pair present |
| `K=256, N=1000` | present, `03` (x2) | 3 | field=32/48 pair present |
| `K=128, N=1000` | present, `07` (x2) + field=144 | 7 | field=32/48 pair present |

**This is a real, previously-unchecked generalization**: bank `0x81`'s
own field=192 formula (`1024 // K - 1`), the exact `N=32`/`N=33`
mutual-exclusivity boundary, the large-`N` field=144 record, and the
large-`N` field=32/48 coexistence pattern are ALL identical between
Gemm and this constant-weight MatMul -- not just similar in character,
byte-identical where Gemm's own values are byte-identical (`4c 05 01`
at `K=512`, `4c 05 03` at `K=256`, `4c 05 07` at `K=128`; `08 03 00 a1`
for field=144; `33 03 00`/`35 03 00 a1` for the field=32/48 pair).

**Content-stable across independent rebuilds**: 3 independently-built
`(K=512, N=1000)` samples with different RNG seeds show byte-identical
bank `0x81`/`0xe1` content -- real compiled content, not per-build
allocator noise.

## One genuine wrinkle, honestly flagged rather than forced: field=112's
## own "constant" is not universal the way Gemm's own version was

Gemm's own field=112 was found constant (`35 81 1a`) across every
`M`/`K` combination PR #1570 tested. Here, at `N=16`, field=112 instead
reads `\\x0d\\x81\\x1a` -- same trailing two bytes, but a DIFFERENT
leading byte than both Gemm's own constant AND this file's own `N=32`
value (which matches Gemm's constant exactly). This means MatMul's
version of field=112 is not a pure constant the way Gemm's was -- it
varies with SOME shape parameter within the "small-N" regime itself
(only `N=16` and `N=32` were checked here; the exact boundary between
the two field=112 forms, and whether it relates to any other already-
known small-shape threshold, is not decoded further in this file).

## Conv: still a clean negative

Two new Conv shapes deliberately built to be "large" in ways plausibly
analogous to Gemm's own `N` trigger -- `cout=64` (a much larger output-
channel count than any prior Conv fixture in this corpus) and
`dilation=16` (twice `tests/test_axera_conv_binary_cluster_higher_dilation.py`
PR #1601's own largest-tested `dilation=8`) -- carry **no** bank `0x81`
or `0xe1` record of any kind. Conv's own only confirmed generalization
of this bank pair remains `0xe1`'s field=32/48 sub-content specifically
(PR #1602's `dilation>=8` finding), not the bank's full mechanism the
way MatMul's constant-weight form now shows.

## What this establishes

Gemm's `0x81`/`0xe1` mutual-exclusivity mechanism is not Gemm-specific
after all -- it is a property of "a matmul-like op with one live tensor
and one compile-time-constant weight matrix," which MatMul can also be
built as (just not the way this project's OWN existing MatMul corpus
happens to have built it, since that corpus's whole purpose was
studying the `A_offset`/`B_offset` coin flip, which requires the
opposite structure). Conv, which has no matching "weight-as-second-
live-matrix-operand" structure at all, only inherits the bank's own
constant SUB-fields (`0xe1`'s field=32/48 pair) without the full
mechanism (the `N`-boundary switch, the `1024//K-1` formula, field=144)
-- consistent with those sub-fields being a smaller, more portable
piece of shared codec vocabulary than the bank's overall triggering
logic.

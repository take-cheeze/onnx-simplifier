"""Formal check for FuseBNIntoConv (fuse_bn_into_conv.h).

The rewrite folds BatchNormalization's affine transform into the preceding
Conv's weight/bias::

    new_W = W * s
    new_b = (B - mean) * s + bias
    s     = scale / sqrt(var + eps)

where ``B`` is the Conv's own pre-existing bias, or 0 if it had none. This
exact formula is also what ``tests/test_fusion_patterns.py``'s
``test_fuse_conv_bn_into_conv_double`` validates numerically against the
compiled pass in float64.

Two independent facts make the fusion sound, combined here into one real
(non-floating-point) arithmetic identity per output element:

1. Conv is linear in its weights for a fixed input, so scaling every weight
   by ``s`` scales the pre-BN output by ``s`` (modeled below with a 2-tap dot
   product -- enough taps to exercise linearity/distributivity, not just a
   single-weight special case).
2. BN's own affine transform, expanded algebraically, is exactly
   ``s * conv_out + (B - mean) * s + bias``.

``sqrt`` is modeled as a real variable ``sq`` constrained by
``sq * sq == var + eps`` and ``sq > 0`` -- the same side condition
fuse_bn_into_conv.h's own division relies on -- rather than as an
uninterpreted function, so Z3's real (nonlinear) arithmetic can discharge the
identity directly instead of reasoning about an opaque sqrt symbol.

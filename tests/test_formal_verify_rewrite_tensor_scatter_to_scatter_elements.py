"""Formal check for RewriteTensorScatterToScatterElements (opt-in; onnxsim's
own ``onnxsim/passes/rewrite_tensor_scatter_to_scatter_elements.h``):
rewrites opset-24 ``TensorScatter(past_cache, update, write_indices, axis,
mode)`` into ``ScatterElements(past_cache, indices, update, axis)``, where
``indices`` is built to have the same shape as ``update`` and
``indices[..., s, ...] = write_indices[batch] + s`` (`s` being that
position's own coordinate along `axis`), optionally wrapped modulo
``max_sequence_length`` for ``mode="circular"``.

``TensorScatter``'s own pseudocode (`onnx/defs/tensor/defs.cc`'s
`TensorScatter_ver24_doc`, matching `onnx/reference/ops/op_tensor_scatter.py`)
is, per batch item `b`:

    for sequence_idx in range(sequence_length):
        cache_sequence_idx = write_indices[b] + sequence_idx   # (+ mod, circular)
        present_cache[b, cache_sequence_idx] = update[b, sequence_idx]

and ``ScatterElements``' own reference algorithm
(`onnx/reference/ops/op_scatter_elements.py`) is, for the rewrite's
same-shape-as-`update` ``indices`` tensor:

    for s in range(sequence_length):
        output[b, indices[b, s]] = update[b, s]

i.e. both are, verbatim, "for every `s` in `update`'s own axis range, write
`update[b, s]` to cache position `f(b, s)`" for the very same function
`f(b, s) = write_indices[b] + s` -- the rewrite's `indices` tensor is
constructed to literally *be* that function. So the substantive thing worth
mechanically checking is not "are these the same loop" (they are, by
construction) but the one piece of nontrivial arithmetic sitting inside it:
for a *fixed* cache position `c`, "does some in-range `s` write to `c`?" is
exactly `s = c - write_indices(b)` landing in `[0, sequence_length)` -- easy
to get backwards (wrong sign, or forgetting to normalize by `write_indices`
at all) the same way `rewrite_gatherelements_to_gather`'s own formal-verify
file warns about for its own index arithmetic. This proof checks that
equivalence: `Exists s in [0, seq_len). c == write_indices(b) + s` iff
`0 <= c - write_indices(b) < seq_len`.

For a *fixed* `b`, `s -> write_indices(b) + s` is plain integer addition and
therefore always injective (`s + k == s2 + k` implies `s == s2` for any
constant `k`, with no extra hypothesis) -- so under "linear" mode there is
never a collision between two different `s` values writing the same cache
position, and the loop's own last-write-wins iteration order is moot: each
cache position receives at most one write, so "the" write and "a" write
coincide. "circular" mode's `% max_sequence_length` is not injective, so this
does not extend to it -- collisions become possible there, and which of
several colliding `sequence_idx` wins depends on iteration order. Both ops
share the same order (`sequence_idx` ascending, matching the rewrite's
`indices` tensor's own `axis`-ascending construction), so a collision
resolves identically either way, but that ordering argument is not what this
proof checks; the negative-control test below instead exhibits a genuine
`Mod` collision to make the boundary of what the closed-form reduction above
covers concrete, and
``test_circular_mode_wraps_around`` in
``tests/test_tensor_scatter_to_scatter_elements.py`` covers "circular" mode's
correctness numerically (onnxsim's own random-input equivalence check).

"""Formal check for StaticQuantizeInt16Conv (opt-in; onnxsim's own
``onnxsim/passes/static_quantize_int16_conv.h``): the Conv-layer sibling of
``static_quantize_int16_matmul.h``, itself the "W8A16" variant of
``static_quantize_matmul.h`` -- weight stays INT8 per-output-channel
symmetric, but the activation widens to UINT16 (instead of UINT8) via
``ComputeAsymmetricUint16QuantParams``, needing opset >= 21 (UINT16
QuantizeLinear/DequantizeLinear support) rather than ``static_quantize_conv.h``'s
opset >= 13. It rewrites ``Y = Conv(X, W)`` (optional bias, a third input,
left completely untouched) -- ``W`` a constant FLOAT32 tensor, rank >= 3
(``[Cout, Cin/groups, k...]``), ``X`` FLOAT32 -- into QDQ format, leaving the
Conv node itself untouched and rewiring only its inputs::

    Xq  = QuantizeLinear(X, Xs, Xzp)          -- Xs/Xzp: CALIBRATED, fixed, uint16
    Xdq = DequantizeLinear(Xq, Xs, Xzp)
    Wdq = DequantizeLinear(Wq, Ws, Wzp, axis=0)    -- symmetric, Wzp spelled
    out explicitly (all zeros, same shape as Ws), int8
    Y   = Conv(Xdq, Wdq)

The ONE structural difference from ``static_quantize_int16_matmul.h`` --
exactly the same simplification ``static_quantize_conv.h`` makes relative to
``static_quantize_matmul.h``: Conv's weight layout ``[Cout, Cin/groups,
k...]`` ALWAYS puts the output channel on axis 0, so unlike Gemm (whose
``transB`` attribute picks between weight stored as ``[N, K]`` or ``[K, N]``)
there is no transposed-layout case here -- ``axis=0`` unconditionally. This
file is this suite's Conv-shaped adaptation of
``test_formal_verify_static_quantize_int16_matmul.py`` in exactly the way
``test_formal_verify_static_quantize_conv.py`` is the Conv-shaped adaptation
of ``test_formal_verify_static_quantize_matmul.py`` -- if that MatMul-sibling
test file exists alongside this one, its general activation-scale
bound/corollary content is this file's primary template; either way, the
Z3 content below is derived directly, following ``test_formal_verify_static_
quantize_conv.py``'s own bound machinery.

Soundness claim
================
Exactly like ``static_quantize_conv`` and ``static_quantize_int16_matmul``,
and unlike ``weight_only_quantize_conv`` (whose bound collapses to a
single-operand special case, ``eps_x := 0``, since ``X`` is never quantized
there), this pass quantizes BOTH operands -- ``quantized_mac_bound``'s own
general two-operand shape, with ``eps_x := Xs / 2`` and ``eps_w := Ws[c] / 2``
both genuinely nonzero::

    |Conv(X, W)[..., c, ...] - Conv(Xdq, Wdq)[..., c, ...]| <=
        (Xs / 2) * sum_k |W[c, k]| + (Ws[c] / 2) * sum_k |X_patch[k]|
        + K * (Xs / 2) * (Ws[c] / 2)

with ``Xs`` here this pass's own (finer) calibrated UINT16 activation scale,
``(hi - lo) / 65535`` rather than ``static_quantize_conv``'s ``(hi - lo) /
255``. Modeling Conv's actual windowed-sum/im2col semantics in Z3 is not
needed, exactly as ``test_formal_verify_static_quantize_conv.py``'s own
docstring explains: once a spatial output position and output channel ``c``
are fixed, that one output element is exactly a dot product of the
receptive-field patch of ``X`` (``Cin/groups * prod(kernel dims)`` values,
flattened) against ``W[c, ...]`` (flattened the same way) -- i.e. precisely
the "one output element is a linear combination of weight and input values"
shape ``quantized_mac_bound`` already models via a small concrete contraction
dimension ``_K``.

The general bound proof (``quantized_mac_bound``'s own lemma, and this file's
``test_static_quantize_int16_conv_error_is_bounded``) is stated with ``Xs``
as an entirely free ``Xs > 0`` real -- it is never given a defining formula
in terms of ``hi``/``lo`` at all, so its hypotheses cannot possibly depend on
*which* divisor (255 or 65535) produced a caller's particular ``Xs``. The
core bound query therefore needs no new nonlinear content versus
``static_quantize_conv``'s own version -- confirmed directly below by reusing
that exact same query, unedited apart from renaming, rather than merely
asserted.

The genuinely new, pass-specific content is the UINT16-vs-UINT8 scale-ratio
corollary (``test_static_quantize_int16_conv_uint16_scale_is_255_over_65535_
times_uint8_scale`` / ``..._is_strictly_finer_than_uint8_scale`` below):
for the SAME calibrated range, this pass's UINT16 scale is exactly
``255 / 65535`` times ``static_quantize_conv``'s own UINT8 scale, and is
strictly finer (smaller) whenever the range is non-degenerate -- mirroring
how ``test_formal_verify_quantize_fp16.py``/``_bf16.py``/``_fp8.py`` each add
their own format's worst-case relative-precision corollary on top of a
shared general round-to-nearest bound.

Carrying the nonzero zero-point through the derivation
========================================================
As in the Conv template, the per-element hypothesis the bound proof needs is
``X``'s own round-trip bound, ``|X[i, k] - Xdq[i, k]| <= Xs / 2``. This file
reproves that round-trip lemma here, with ``Xzp`` a genuinely free (and, in
the differential tests below, genuinely nonzero) variable -- the algebra
shows exactly why the bound doesn't care: dequantizing subtracts back out
exactly the zero-point that quantizing added, for ANY zero-point value, as
long as nothing clips. That "as long as nothing clips" matters -- the same
explicit side condition ``test_formal_verify_quantize_round_trip.py`` calls
out for its own lemma -- and, as in the Conv template, the differential tests
below calibrate from the actual data range being tested (so nothing clips
there) rather than asserting it away.

No consumer-composition step is added here, matching this suite's usual
reasoning for a numeric *bound* (as opposed to an *equality*) claim: an
arbitrary consumer need not be Lipschitz, so a bound on
``|Conv(X, W) - Conv(Xdq, Wdq)|`` does not in general bound anything about
``|consumer(Conv(X, W)) - consumer(Conv(Xdq, Wdq))|``.

Avoiding the reconstructed-dequantized-value shape
====================================================
As ``test_formal_verify_dynamic_quantize_matmul.py``'s own module docstring
documents in full, reconstructing a dequantized value from separate
quantized-code/zero-point multiplicands inside a bound-proving Z3 query has
repeatedly caused Z3 to hang past 90s in this suite. Every Z3 query below
uses the direct-error-variable (``ex``/``ew``) idiom instead -- each
operand's dequantization error is a free Real bounded directly by its own
rounding hypothesis -- exactly like every other bound-proving file in this
suite, including this file's own two templates.

Invoking the pass with a specific calibrated range
====================================================
As ``test_formal_verify_static_quantize_conv.py``'s own docstring explains in
full for ``quantize_static``: the actual nanobind-exposed entry point for
THIS pass family is ``onnxsim.onnxsim_cpp2py_export.quantize_static_int16
(model_bytes, activation_ranges)`` (see ``QuantizeStaticInt16`` in
``onnxsim/quantize_entry.cpp``), which takes a caller-supplied ``{tensor
name: (min, max)}`` dict directly and runs ``OptimizeFixed`` with exactly
``["static_quantize_int16_matmul", "static_quantize_int16_conv"]`` -- i.e. it
already isolates this pass family (confirmed here to include
``static_quantize_int16_conv`` via ``onnxsim.onnxsim_cpp2py_export.
_list_other_optimizers()``) with no extra ``skipped_optimizers``/
``simplify_isolated_extra`` machinery, and applies the rewrite with no shape
inference or other simplification alongside it. The differential tests below
call it directly, exactly like the Conv template does with
``quantize_static``, and check the proved bound directly against
onnxruntime's own execution of the rewritten graph rather than onnxsim's own
random-input equivalence check.

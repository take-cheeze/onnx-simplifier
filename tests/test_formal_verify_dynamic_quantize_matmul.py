"""Formal check for DynamicQuantizeMatMul (opt-in; onnxsim's own
``onnxsim/passes/dynamic_quantize_matmul.h``): the exact inverse of the
rewrite ``defuse_matmul_integer_to_float.h`` folds back
(``test_formal_verify_defuse_matmul_integer_to_float.py`` is this file's
direct template for the Z3 vocabulary). It rewrites ``Y = MatMul(X, W)`` (or
a "vanilla" ``Gemm``, ``+ Bias`` optional) -- ``W`` a constant 2-D FLOAT32
tensor, ``X`` FLOAT32 -- into::

    Xq, Xs, Xzp = DynamicQuantizeLinear(X)          # per-tensor UINT8, runtime scale
    Acc         = MatMulInteger(Xq, Wq, Xzp)        # int32, implicit b_zero_point=0
    Y           = Cast<float>(Acc) * (Xs * Ws)      # (+ Bias, if present)

``Wq`` (INT8) and ``Ws`` (FLOAT32, one scale per output column) are computed
ONCE at pass-transform time from ``W``'s static values, ordinary
per-output-channel symmetric quantization (``QuantizeWeightPerChannelKN``);
``Xq``/``Xs``/``Xzp`` are computed at *run time* by ``DynamicQuantizeLinear``
from each run's actual activation range.

Unlike ``defuse_matmul_integer_to_float`` -- which folds an *already*
quantized chain back into a plain ``MatMul`` and is an EXACT equivalence
given ``DynamicQuantizeLinear``'s own defining dequantization identity --
this pass runs in the other direction, from an exact float computation to a
quantized approximation of it, and is genuinely LOSSY: both the dynamic
UINT8 quantization of ``X`` and the static INT8 quantization of ``W``
introduce their own rounding error. The claim this file proves is therefore
the bounded-error shape ``test_formal_verify_quantized_mac_bound.py``
establishes for exactly this kind of thing, not an exact-equivalence claim:
the rewritten output differs from the true float ``MatMul(X, W)`` by an
amount boundable in terms of the two quantization steps' own per-element
rounding bounds, propagated through the reduction the way a dot product's
own linearity plus the triangle inequality allows
(``quantized_mac_bound``'s own derivation, reused here almost verbatim --
see below for why "almost").

Per-element rounding bounds (standard round-to-nearest quantize/dequantize
bound, ``|value - dequant(quant(value))| <= scale / 2``), for one output
element ``Y[i, n]`` (a fixed but arbitrary row ``i``, column ``n``; the
concrete reduction depth is ``_K``, matching ``quantized_mac_bound``'s own
``_K``, see below)::

    dequant_x[k] := Xs * (Xq[i, k] - Xzp)     |X[i, k]  - dequant_x[k]| <= Xs / 2
    dequant_w[k] := Ws(n) * Wq[k, n]          |W[k, n]  - dequant_w[k]| <= Ws(n) / 2

``Cast<float>(Acc)[i, n] * (Xs * Ws(n))`` -- the pass's own literal node
chain, call it ``y`` -- is then an EXACT ring identity (no rounding involved,
just redistributing the shared ``Xs * Ws(n)`` factor into the sum) away from
the elementwise-dequantized dot product::

    y == sum_k (Xq[i, k] - Xzp) * Wq[k, n] * (Xs * Ws(n))
      == sum_k dequant_x[k] * dequant_w[k]

so bounding ``MatMul(X, W)[i, n] - sum_k dequant_x[k] * dequant_w[k]`` bounds
``MatMul(X, W)[i, n] - y`` too. That second bound is EXACTLY
``quantized_mac_bound``'s own lemma, with ``eps_w := Ws(n) / 2`` and
``eps_x := Xs / 2`` substituted for its free ``eps_w``/``eps_x``::

    |MatMul(X, W)[i, n] - y| <=
        (Xs / 2) * sum_k |W[k, n]| + (Ws(n) / 2) * sum_k |X[i, k]|
        + _K * (Xs / 2) * (Ws(n) / 2)

Why two separate lemmas (an exact identity plus a reused bound) instead of
one direct Z3 proof of the combined claim, the way
``defuse_matmul_integer_to_float``'s single-shot proof works: empirically,
handing Z3 the combined nonlinear statement in one go -- whether by literally
writing ``y``'s ``Acc * (Xs * Ws)`` form (a Mul of a sum-of-products by
another product) into the same formula as the abs-value bound, or even by
adding the identity above as an extra hypothesis to the very same implication
-- makes its nonlinear-arithmetic search hang well past a minute at ``_K`` as
small as 2 (confirmed directly: over 90 seconds, versus a few milliseconds
for the identity alone). This suite has hit exactly this kind of Z3 blowup
before (see ``fuse_consecutive_log_softmax``'s original ``ForAll`` hang,
fixed by ground instantiation) -- here the fix is the same idea one level up:
keep each individual Z3 query in the tractable shape an already-working proof
in this suite uses, and combine the two results by ordinary mathematical
substitution in the surrounding Python/prose rather than asking Z3 to search
the combined nonlinear formula itself.

The two lemmas below don't just split the same formulas into two `prove()`
calls, either -- the bound lemma (``_bound_formulas``) is deliberately
reformulated to drop ``Xq``/``Wq``/``Xzp``/``Xs``/``Ws`` products entirely in
favor of *direct* per-tap error variables (``ex``/``ew``, each a free Real
bounded straight by the rounding hypothesis, exactly
``quantized_mac_bound``'s own ``ew``/``ex`` idiom), rather than re-deriving
each tap's dequantized value from separate quantized-code/scale/zero-point
multiplicands the way the identity lemma (``_identity_formulas``) does. Both
formulations describe the same ``dequant_elemwise`` quantity -- the identity
lemma is what connects it back to the pass's own literal node chain -- but
handing Z3 the *extra* ``Xs*(Xq-Xzp)``-shaped multiplications inside the same
query as the abs-value bound search is exactly what caused the hang above;
dropping them from the bound query specifically (while keeping them where
they're actually needed, in the identity query) brings its cost back down to
about ``quantized_mac_bound``'s own ~20s at the same ``_K``. ``_K = 2`` (not
the ``e.g. 3`` a first cut might reach for) is chosen for the same reason
``quantized_mac_bound`` itself uses ``_K = 2`` -- it is already enough to
exercise the cross-tap sum, and larger ``_K`` was empirically too slow for
this shape of query.

``Xq``/``Wq`` (in the identity lemma) are modeled as plain Z3 Reals, not the
Int-sorted functions ``defuse_matmul_integer_to_float``'s proof uses for the
analogous quantized codes: this proof's argument only ever uses the
rounding-error bound each code satisfies, never that it is integer-valued,
and empirically even reintroducing Int sorts and per-(i, k)/(k, n)
uninterpreted functions (rather than plain per-tap variables for one fixed,
arbitrary (i, n)) reopens the same kind of Z3 blowup. Nothing about the
soundness argument depends on ranging over an unbounded ``Function``: the
claim is already about one representative output element, exactly as
``quantized_mac_bound``'s own dot-product lemma is.

A negative-control test confirms the rounding-error hypotheses are load-
bearing: with no error budget assumed at all, the exact-equality claim
``MatMul(X, W)[i, n] == y`` is not a theorem -- Z3 finds a real
counterexample -- so the bound above is not vacuously satisfied by some
accidentally-always-equal pair of expressions.

No consumer-composition step (this suite's usual substitution-safety idiom,
e.g. ``test_formal_verify_eliminate_identity.py``) is added here: composing
an arbitrary ``consumer`` with an *equality* is immediate
(``consumer(a) == consumer(b)`` follows from ``a == b`` for any function
``consumer``), but no such general principle holds for a numeric *bound* --
an arbitrary ``consumer`` need not be Lipschitz, let alone 1-Lipschitz, so
"``|a - b| <= bound``" does not in general imply anything about
"``|consumer(a) - consumer(b)|``" at all. ``quantized_mac_bound`` itself,
this file's template for this shape of claim, does not attempt such a
composition either.

Differential tests build a plain float ``MatMul`` via ``onnx.parser``, run
the real pass through :func:`onnxsim.quantize_dynamic` (applying
``dynamic_quantize_matmul`` alone, per that function's own docstring), and
confirm: the exact ``DynamicQuantizeLinear -> MatMulInteger -> Cast -> Mul ->
Mul`` chain fires; the ``Wq``/``Ws`` initializers match an independent numpy
re-implementation of ``QuantizeWeightPerChannelKN``'s formula; the actual
runtime output error (against onnxruntime's own ``DynamicQuantizeLinear``
output, not a hand-reimplemented one) stays within the bound proved above,
mirroring ``quantized_mac_bound``'s own
``test_quantized_mac_bound_matches_onnxruntime``; and a pre-opset-11 model
(``DynamicQuantizeLinear`` needs opset >= 11) is declined outright, the
simplest of the pass's several decline conditions to exercise.

The firing tests below pass ``check_n=0`` to ``simplify_isolated_extra`` --
confirmed empirically, not assumed -- since this really is a lossy INT8
rewrite: onnxsim's own random-input equivalence check (its default
``check_n=3``, tolerance ``rtol=1e-4``/``atol=1e-5``) fails on the quantized
output at that tolerance, the same reasoning
``test_formal_verify_defuse_matmul_integer_to_float.py`` documents for its
own ``check_n=0`` (there, for the reverse direction).

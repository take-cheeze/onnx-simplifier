"""Tests for ``onnxsim.apply_qat`` (see ``onnxsim/qat.py``) -- label-free,
block-wise quantization-aware fine-tuning: the float model is the teacher, the
quantized model is the student, and the loss is the block's own output
reconstruction error.

Two claims separate this from the six rounding passes already in the tree, and
each is *measured* here rather than assumed:

1. the block may be any topology :mod:`onnxsim.graph_grad` can differentiate,
   including the activation-between-two-Linears shape
   :func:`onnxsim.apply_brecq` refuses outright (asserted directly: BRECQ
   returns the model unchanged on the very graph this trains);
2. the fp32 weights themselves move, not only their floor/ceil choice.

Claim 2 is the one with a nuance, and the test that makes it records the
nuance instead of hiding it: freeing the weights wins where the reconstruction
problem is *underdetermined*, and loses to AdaRound's smoother relaxation
where it is not. Both directions are measured below.

The second half of this file covers the whole-model entry points --
:func:`onnxsim.discover_qat_blocks`, which partitions a model into trainable
blocks with no caller-named tensors at all, and
:func:`onnxsim.apply_qat_all_blocks`, which walks them in order. The claim
there that is genuinely uncertain, and therefore measured rather than
asserted, is whether feeding each block the *student's* recomputed activation
beats capturing every block's input once from the teacher; see
``test_sequential_input_beats_capturing_everything_once`` for the numbers and
the direction they actually came out in.

The same half also records the *rejected* direction. Training the whole graph
at once against the model's own output -- the end-to-end objective the
block-wise loss only approximates -- needs no new entry point, because a block
may be the whole graph; ``test_the_whole_graph_is_a_legal_block`` pins that,
and ``test_the_end_to_end_objective_overfits_where_block_wise_does_not``
measures what it is worth, which on a deep model is less than nothing.

    Three things have to hold for the degenerate case to *be* the end-to-end
    objective, and all three are checked: discovery proposes the whole graph
    as one block once the merge budget allows it; every quantized layer in
    the model is trained jointly inside a single step graph (one master
    weight and two Adam moments each, all in one graph's state, driven by one
    loss); and the only tensor captured from the teacher besides the target
    is the graph's own input -- so nothing anywhere in the run is
    teacher-forced at a boundary the deployed model would compute for itself.

    And it trains: on this three-stage stack the whole-model reconstruction
    loss falls 0.073 -> 0.011 over 200 steps and the model's own output error
    against the float model goes 12.2 -> 4.8. Whether that is *better* than
    spending the same steps block-wise is the next test's question, not this
    one's.

    """The measurement that decided against recommending the end-to-end pass.

    Both runs get the same model, the same calibration rows and the same
    total number of Adam steps. The block-wise walk spends them on eight
    stage-sized reconstruction problems against the teacher's own
    intermediate activations; the end-to-end run spends them on one problem
    against the model's final output, which is the objective the walk's
    per-block losses are only a surrogate for.

    End-to-end therefore *has* to win on the calibration set, and does -- and
    the number that matters is the other one. Measured on this scenario
    (eight stages, 64 calibration rows, 1600 optimizer steps either way,
    seed 0): calibration-set output error 14.74 block-wise against 11.68
    end-to-end, 21% better; held-out error on 1024 fresh rows 113.6
    block-wise against 120.6 end-to-end, 6% *worse*. Across seeds 0-7 the
    direction held every time, end-to-end between 12% and 26% better on the
    calibration set and between 1% and 12% worse off it.

    That is an overfitting signature, and it is :mod:`onnxsim.brecq`'s own
    argument for the block being the right unit: pinning every intermediate
    activation to the teacher's is a far stronger constraint than pinning
    only the final output, and at calibration scale the constraint is worth
    more than the freedom. If this test failed, end-to-end would be buying
    real accuracy rather than calibration-set fit, and the module docstring's
    advice to stay block-wise on a deep model would be wrong.

    **What is asserted, and why it is not the 6%.**
    ``test_the_whole_model_walk_trains_activation_quantizers_too`` established
    that a whole-model error *ratio* measured through many layers and
    hundreds of steps of a discretely non-smooth objective is not stable
    across onnxruntime builds -- it moved from 0.565 to 0.929 in CI on a
    bit-identical input. The 6% held-out figure above is a quantity of
    exactly that kind, so the sign of the small difference is recorded here
    and not asserted. What is asserted is the divergence itself, which is
    what the finding rests on: a double-digit gain on the calibration set
    that produces no gain at all off it. A run that genuinely generalized
    would move both numbers together.

    The end-to-end run also costs about the block count in wall clock for the
    same step budget (one step touches every layer, not two), which this does
    not assert because timing assertions do not belong in CI, but which is
    the other half of why it is not the default.

def test_training_the_activation_quantizer_beats_training_the_weights_alone():

    binding constraint.

    ``_outlier_calibrated`` gives the model a min/max activation range set by
    one unrepresentative sample, ~30x wider than the data it is then trained
    and measured on -- so most of the remaining error is activation
    quantization, and no amount of weight fine-tuning can reach it. The
    baseline is *not* a weight-only run of a different scheme (that would
    compare two different models); it is this same joint run with
    ``activation_learning_rate=0``, which freezes the quantizer while training
    the weights against the same activation-quantized forward.

    **Measured, whole-model output error against the float model** (seed 0,
    800 steps, ``activation_learning_rate=1e-1``): round-to-nearest 4.73,
    weights alone 4.08, weights + activation quantizers 2.54 -- 38% below the
    weights-alone run. Across seeds 0-2: 38%, 43%, 38%.

    **The honest boundaries, and the third one is the important one.**

    1. *At the default learning rate the margin is much smaller.* The same
       runs at ``activation_learning_rate=1e-2`` (the default, matching
       :func:`onnxsim.apply_adaquant`) land at 3.47 / 3.38 / 3.51 -- 15-24%
       rather than 38-43%. The scale has ~3 log units to travel here and
       ``lr_decay`` anneals the budget away, so a badly calibrated range wants
       a larger rate. The test passes 1e-1 and says so rather than quietly
       tuning the default to the scenario.
    2. *Re-calibrating is cheaper.* With a range this wrong, calibrating on
       representative data (or ``calibrate(method="mse")``) is a forward pass,
       not 800 optimizer steps, and should be tried first. What training buys
       over re-calibrating is a range optimal for the reconstruction *loss*
       rather than for the observed min and max.
    3. **And when the range is already right, this does not help.** The same
       comparison with the same model calibrated on the same clean data
       (no outlier) reads round-to-nearest 1.51, weights alone 1.23, joint
       1.23 at the default rate and 1.27 at 1e-1 -- a *regression* at both,
       on all three seeds: 0.5-4% at the default, 3-6% at 1e-1. That is not
       a tuning failure, it is the shape of the problem: min/max on
       representative data is already close to MSE-optimal (the reason
       ``calibrate(method="mse")`` buys little), the remaining error is the
       weights' and the INT8 grid's, and a second coupled parameter group
       makes a solved problem harder rather than a hard one easier. So this
       flag is for a quantizer whose range is *wrong*, and the module says so.

    ratio.** It originally required the end-to-end error to fall to 0.6x the

    bit-identical starting point -- same float model, same calibration, same
    quantized model, confirmed by the baseline error agreeing to fifteen
    digits. Three candidate explanations were measured and ruled out. Input
    perturbation at the 1e-7..1e-5 level moves the ratio only within
    0.565-0.590, nowhere near 0.929, so it is not ulp-level sensitivity to
    the data. Pinning the process to one, two or four CPUs reproduces the
    local figure bit-for-bit, so it is not reduction order varying with
    thread count. And it is neither architecture nor operating system: the
    Linux x86 and Windows x86 jobs failed with *bit-identical* trained

    the same architecture. What those two share and this machine does not is
    the dependency set CI resolves at install time (``CIBW_TEST_REQUIRES``
    pins no onnxruntime version), which makes the runtime build the
    remaining explanation. That was not confirmed by installing CI's
    resolution here, so it is the strongly indicated cause rather than a
    demonstrated one.

    What is established is that a ratio measured through four layers, an
    outlier-calibrated quantizer and 300 Adam steps of a discretely
    non-smooth objective is not a stable quantity across runtimes, and this
    test does not need it to be: its subject is the *plumbing* -- that the
    flag reaches discovery and training and that every quantizer moves. So
    the mechanism is asserted directly, on each block's own reconstruction
    loss (the objective the optimizer actually minimizes, in the same graph,
    on the same data), and the whole-model check is kept only as the
    invariant it genuinely is: training the quantizers must not make the

    ``tests/test_block_finetune.py``). Quantization hides that: a weight has
    to drift half a quantization step before ``round(w / s)`` reports anything
    but 0, so at ``apply_qat``'s default learning rate of 1e-4 a short run
    moves no code off zero at all and the problem is invisible.

    It is invisible, not absent. Measured on this model at 300 iterations, the
    number of pruned zeros that came back as nonzero codes was 6 at lr 1e-3,
    38 at 1e-2 and 177 at 5e-2 -- a sparsity that erodes with the learning
    rate and the budget, which is a worse way to lose it than losing it
    outright. With the flag on it is 0 at every rate.

# onnx-finetune

A small C++ CLI that fine-tunes an ONNX model in place, using ONNX Runtime's
on-device training API, and exports a normal inference-ready `.onnx` file.
No PyTorch, no re-export from a training framework -- it trains directly
against the ONNX graph.

## How it fits together

Fine-tuning a bare `.onnx` file with ONNX Runtime is a two-step workflow,
split across two different tools because of where each capability lives:

1. **`scripts/generate_artifacts.py`** (Python, one-time, offline) -- builds
   the gradient graph for your model and writes four files: `training_model.onnx`,
   `eval_model.onnx`, `optimizer_model.onnx`, `checkpoint`. This step needs
   Python because gradient-graph construction (`onnxruntime.training.artifacts`)
   is only exposed there -- there is no C/C++ API for it.
2. **`onnx-finetune`** (this C++ binary, runs training) -- loads those four
   files and runs the actual train loop (forward, backward, optimizer step)
   purely through ONNX Runtime's native C++ API, with zero Python dependency.
   It exports the trained result back to a plain `.onnx` file at the end.

This split is deliberate, not a limitation of this tool specifically: it's
how ONNX Runtime's on-device training is designed to be deployed (mobile/edge
apps generate artifacts once during a build step, then ship only the C++/Java/
Swift runtime, never Python).

## Prerequisite: a training-enabled ONNX Runtime build

For `scripts/generate_artifacts.py` (and, if you'd rather train from Python
than build the C++ CLI below, `onnxruntime.training.api` too): just
`pip install onnxruntime-training` -- a separate PyPI distribution from
plain `onnxruntime`, published by the ONNX Runtime team with
`onnxruntime.training.artifacts`/`.api` included, no source build needed.
(Pinned at 1.19.2 as of this writing -- there have been no newer releases of
this particular distribution; match that version if you build `onnx-
finetune` itself from source per the following, to keep the artifact
format and IR version expectations aligned between the two.)

`onnxruntime.training`'s own `__init__.py` unconditionally imports an `optim`
submodule that unconditionally imports `torch` -- for an apex/FP16
optimizer-modifier interop this tool never touches, but `pip install
onnxruntime-training` does not pull `torch` in as a dependency, so a clean
environment fails on `import onnxruntime.training.artifacts` with
`ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'torch'` until you install it too (a
CPU-only build is enough: `pip install torch --index-url
https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu`).

`onnx-finetune` itself (the C++ CLI) and its WASM binding are a different
story: neither the `pip install onnxruntime` wheels nor the official
prebuilt release tarballs (the ones under GitHub Releases) include the
training C++ headers/library at all, in any distribution -- for those two,
you need to build ONNX Runtime from source with training enabled, once:

```sh
git clone --branch v1.19.2 https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime.git
cd onnxruntime
git submodule update --init --recursive

python3 tools/ci_build/build.py \
  --build_dir build --config Release --parallel \
  --skip_tests --allow_running_as_root \
  --build_shared_lib --enable_training_apis
```

This is a real ~20-40 minute build (protobuf, abseil, onnx, and ONNX Runtime
itself, all from source). `--enable_training_apis` is enough for the C++ CLI
and WASM binding (no Python bindings needed, so no `--enable_pybind
--build_wheel`); if you separately need a from-source *Python* build of
`onnxruntime.training` for some reason `pip install onnxruntime-training`
doesn't cover (a different commit, GPU support, ...), add `--enable_training
--enable_pybind --build_wheel` instead of `--enable_training_apis` -- and if
`pip install .` on that wheel build fails with a `setuptools`/`distutils`
`install_layout` error, that's an unrelated packaging-step bug in older
`setup.py` against newer `setuptools`: the compiled Python module already
exists by that point, at `<build_dir>/Release/build/lib/`, and can be used
directly by pointing `PYTHONPATH` there without needing an installed wheel:

```sh
PYTHONPATH=/path/to/onnxruntime/build/Release/build/lib \
  python3 scripts/generate_artifacts.py ...
```

## Building onnx-finetune

```sh
cmake -B build \
  -DORT_SOURCE_DIR=/path/to/onnxruntime \
  -DORT_BUILD_DIR=/path/to/onnxruntime/build/Release
cmake --build build
```

`onnx-finetune-distill-step-graph` (see "Knowledge distillation" below) is a
separate target with a much lighter requirement -- `ORT_HOME` pointing at *any* plain
onnxruntime distribution that ships `onnxruntime_cxx_api.h` + `libonnxruntime`, no
`--enable_training_apis` build needed at all:

```sh
# An official prebuilt release works -- no build, no ORT_SOURCE_DIR/ORT_BUILD_DIR.
curl -sSL -o ort.tgz https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/releases/download/v1.30.0/onnxruntime-linux-x64-1.30.0.tgz
tar xzf ort.tgz
cmake -B build -DORT_HOME=$PWD/onnxruntime-linux-x64-1.30.0
cmake --build build --target onnx-finetune-distill-step-graph
```

Both `-DORT_SOURCE_DIR`/`-DORT_BUILD_DIR` and `-DORT_HOME` can be given to the same `cmake -B
build` invocation to build both tools at once; each is independently optional (whichever
you omit, that tool's target is simply skipped).

## Usage

```sh
# 1. Generate training artifacts for your model (offline, once).
python3 scripts/generate_artifacts.py model.onnx -o artifacts --loss mse --optimizer adamw

# Freeze everything except a subset (e.g. only fine-tune a head/adapter --
# this is what keeps memory and compute down on larger models):
python3 scripts/generate_artifacts.py model.onnx -o artifacts \
  --freeze-prefix backbone. --loss cross-entropy --optimizer adamw

# 2. Run the actual training loop.
./build/onnx-finetune \
  --artifacts-dir artifacts \
  --train-input train_input.bin --train-target train_target.bin \
  --input-dim 4 --target-dim 1 --num-samples 2048 \
  --batch-size 32 --epochs 20 --lr 0.01 \
  --output-model finetuned.onnx --output-names output
```

`--train-input`/`--train-target` are raw contiguous `float32` binary files
(`num_samples * dim` values each, row-major) -- deliberately the simplest
possible format so the tool has no dataset-library dependency. Convert
whatever you actually have (images, tokenized text, ...) to that layout
before calling this; see `scripts/make_synthetic_data.py` for a minimal
example of writing the format from numpy.

`finetuned.onnx` is a normal inference-only ONNX model afterward -- load it
with any ONNX Runtime build (including a plain `pip install onnxruntime`,
verified in testing), `onnxsim` it, ship it, whatever you'd normally do.

## Try it end-to-end with the included toy example

```sh
python3 scripts/make_toy_model.py -o toy_model.onnx
python3 scripts/make_synthetic_data.py --num-samples 2048
python3 scripts/generate_artifacts.py toy_model.onnx -o artifacts
./build/onnx-finetune \
  --artifacts-dir artifacts \
  --train-input train_input.bin --train-target train_target.bin \
  --input-dim 4 --target-dim 1 --num-samples 2048 \
  --batch-size 32 --epochs 20 --lr 0.01 \
  --output-model finetuned.onnx --output-names output
```

The toy task is learning `y = sum(x)` with a 2-layer MLP; loss should drop
from roughly 5 to under 0.001 over the 20 epochs.

## LoRA (low-rank adaptation)

`--freeze-prefix` above still trains full-size parameter tensors, just fewer
of them. For real LoRA -- freezing every original weight and training only a
pair of small rank-decomposition matrices alongside each targeted layer --
use `scripts/inject_lora.py` to do the graph surgery first, then point
`generate_artifacts.py` at the resulting adapter manifest:

```sh
# 1. Graft a rank-4 adapter onto every eligible MatMul/Gemm weight (or use
#    --target-contains to pick specific layers, e.g. --target-contains q_proj).
python3 scripts/inject_lora.py model.onnx -o model_lora.onnx \
  --rank 4 --params-out lora.json

# 2. Generate training artifacts that train *only* the injected lora_A/lora_B
#    tensors -- everything else (including the original weights) is frozen.
python3 scripts/generate_artifacts.py model_lora.onnx -o artifacts \
  --lora-params-file lora.json --loss cross-entropy --optimizer adamw

# 3. Train as usual.
./build/onnx-finetune --artifacts-dir artifacts ... --output-model finetuned.onnx --output-names output

# 4. Pull just the trained adapter back out (a few KB, not the whole model).
python3 scripts/extract_lora_adapter.py finetuned.onnx --params-file lora.json -o adapter.onnx

# 5. Re-apply that adapter to any fresh copy of the base model, no retraining.
python3 scripts/apply_lora_adapter.py model.onnx --adapter adapter.onnx \
  --params-file lora.json -o finetuned2.onnx
```

`inject_lora.py` adds, per targeted weight `W`, a
`(alpha/rank) * (X @ lora_A @ lora_B)` branch alongside that layer's existing
output (`lora_A` Kaiming-normal, `lora_B` zero, so injecting is a no-op until
trained). Eligible layers are MatMul, Gemm (any `transA`/`transB`), and
1x1/`group=1` Conv (a pointwise conv is just a per-pixel linear layer over
channels) -- see `scripts/lora_surgery.py`'s own docstring for the exact
rule. `adapter.onnx` from step 4 is not a runnable model by itself -- it's a
plain tensor container holding just the `lora_A`/`lora_B` initializers --
meant to be re-merged with `apply_lora_adapter.py`, not loaded directly into
a session. This is a portable, ONNX-native adapter format built on these
scripts, distinct from ONNX Runtime's own `.onnx_adapter` file format
described next.

### Loading an adapter natively at inference time (no Olive needed)

`apply_lora_adapter.py`/`extract_lora_adapter.py` above bake one specific
trained adapter into its own merged copy of the model. ONNX Runtime has a
native alternative for swapping adapters in and out of a *single* loaded
session instead: `onnxruntime.LoraAdapter` / `RunOptions.add_active_adapter`
(ORT >= 1.20), fed by a `.onnx_adapter` file. People usually reach that
format through Microsoft's separate Olive tool (`olive convert-adapters`),
but Olive's own command is a thin wrapper around one public onnxruntime
class (`onnxruntime.AdapterFormat`) -- see `ConvertAdaptersCommand.run` in
Olive's source. `scripts/export_onnx_adapter.py` calls that class directly,
needing only `onnxruntime` itself (no `olive-ai`/`torch`/`peft`):

```sh
# 1. Inject with --adapter-inputs: lora_A/lora_B become optional graph
#    inputs (defaulting to their baked initializer) instead of pure
#    constants, so ONNX Runtime can override them at Run() time.
python3 scripts/inject_lora.py model.onnx -o model_lora.onnx \
  --rank 4 --adapter-inputs --params-out lora.json

# 2-3. Generate artifacts and train exactly as in the plain-LoRA workflow.

# 4. Extract the trained adapter as usual.
python3 scripts/extract_lora_adapter.py finetuned.onnx --params-file lora.json -o adapter.onnx

# 5. Export it to ONNX Runtime's native format.
python3 scripts/export_onnx_adapter.py adapter.onnx --params-file lora.json -o adapter.onnx_adapter
```

```python
import onnxruntime as ort

session = ort.InferenceSession("model_lora.onnx")  # loaded once
adapter = ort.LoraAdapter()
adapter.Load("adapter.onnx_adapter")
run_opts = ort.RunOptions()
run_opts.add_active_adapter(adapter)  # swap adapters per call, no reload
outputs = session.run(None, {"input": x}, run_options=run_opts)
```

Calling `session.run` without an active adapter falls back to the baked
(zero-init, or whatever `apply_lora_adapter.py --adapter-inputs` last
applied) default -- verified end-to-end in
`tests/test_lora.py::test_export_onnx_adapter_matches_merged_model_via_native_lora_adapter`,
which checks this against the merged-model output bit for bit. `--adapter-
inputs` is also available on `apply_lora_adapter.py`, for turning a
specific trained adapter into a natively swappable base model without
retraining. `export_onnx_adapter.py`'s tensor names only need to be
internally consistent with the model's own graph input names (both come
from this same toolchain); unlike Olive's own HuggingFace-oriented naming
convention, there is no fixed scheme to match here.

### QLoRA (NF4-quantized base + LoRA)

`scripts/prepare_qlora.py` wires the LoRA graph surgery above together with
`onnxsim.nf4.quantize_weight_only_nf4` (bitsandbytes' NF4 4-bit format, see
`onnxsim/nf4.py`) to reproduce Dettmers et al. 2023's actual QLoRA recipe:
freeze a 4-bit-quantized base model and train small full-precision adapters
on top of its on-the-fly dequantized weights, instead of plain LoRA on an
unquantized base. It replaces step 1 above; steps 2-5 are unchanged:

```sh
python3 scripts/prepare_qlora.py model.onnx -o model_qlora.onnx \
  --rank 4 --block-size 64 --params-out lora.json

python3 scripts/generate_artifacts.py model_qlora.onnx -o artifacts \
  --lora-params-file lora.json --loss cross-entropy --optimizer adamw
# ...then train, extract, and re-apply exactly as in the plain-LoRA workflow.
```

This needs the `onnxsim` package itself importable (build/install this
repo's own wheel) for the NF4 quantization step -- unlike every other
onnx-finetune script, which needs only `onnx` + `numpy`. Injection must run
before quantization (quantizing first leaves nothing recognizable for
`inject_lora.py`'s graph surgery to graft onto), and `prepare_qlora.py`
always excludes the newly-injected `lora_A`/`lora_B` weights from
quantization itself -- structurally they're just another small MatMul
against a 2-D initializer, indistinguishable from any other layer's weight
by shape alone, so leaving them eligible would NF4-quantize the adapter too
and defeat the point of keeping it full precision. NF4 quantization only
covers 2-D MatMul/vanilla-Gemm weights (see `onnxsim/nf4.py`), so a 1x1-Conv
LoRA target stays full precision under `prepare_qlora.py` too.

## Knowledge distillation -- no training-enabled ONNX Runtime at all

Train a small "student" classifier to mimic a larger "teacher" via knowledge distillation
(Hinton et al. -- temperature-scaled soft-target cross-entropy, combined with the usual
hard-label cross-entropy). Unlike every other loss mode in this tool,
`scripts/generate_distillation_step_graph.py` differentiates the whole student forward pass
and the KD loss itself with onnxsim's own reverse-mode autodiff (`onnxsim.graph_grad`/
`onnxsim.qat_graph` -- the same machinery `onnxsim.lora`/`onnxsim.qat` already use to avoid
`onnxruntime.training` for LoRA and block-wise QAT), instead of going through
`generate_artifacts.py`/`onnxruntime.training.artifacts` at all. The result is **one**
ordinary ONNX graph -- forward, loss, backward, and an Adam step all baked in -- runnable by
repeatedly calling `session.run()`/`Run()` on a **plain, non-training** onnxruntime. No
`pip install onnxruntime-training`, no from-source `--enable_training_apis` build, anywhere in
this path -- see that script's own module docstring for the full design writeup. The step
graph's batch dimension is a `dim_param`, decided per call rather than fixed when the graph is
built -- the same compiled graph runs any batch size, chosen freely each step via
`--batch-size` below.

```sh
# 1. A teacher (bigger) and a student (smaller) classifier -- any two ONNX
#    models producing (batch, num_classes) logits work; make_toy_classifier.py
#    is provided for trying this out without one of your own.
python3 scripts/make_toy_classifier.py -o teacher.onnx --hidden-dim 32 --num-classes 4
python3 scripts/make_toy_classifier.py -o student.onnx --hidden-dim 8  --num-classes 4

# 2. One step graph with a dynamic batch dimension. Also writes step.onnx.manifest.txt
#    and step.onnx.initial_state.bin alongside it -- a non-Python caller (the native CLI
#    below, or the wasm runner) needs both to actually run it.
python3 scripts/generate_distillation_step_graph.py student.onnx -o step.onnx

# 3. Synthetic classification data: int64 labels (this path builds its own one-hot
#    matrix from them on the host, see the script's docstring on why that's not
#    done in-graph) -- see make_synthetic_data.py for the plain-regression
#    equivalent this tool's other --loss modes use.
python3 scripts/make_synthetic_classification_data.py --num-classes 4 --num-samples 2048

# 4. Train with the plain-onnxruntime native tool (see "Building" below for ORT_HOME) --
#    a completely separate binary from ./build/onnx-finetune, built against a *plain*
#    onnxruntime (an official prebuilt release tarball works, no build at all). --batch-size
#    is just how many samples to feed per step -- freely choosable, and needn't divide
#    --num-samples evenly (the last step of each epoch uses whatever is left).
./build/onnx-finetune-distill-step-graph \
  --step-graph step.onnx --teacher-model teacher.onnx \
  --train-input train_input.bin --train-target train_labels.bin --num-samples 2048 \
  --batch-size 32 --epochs 20 --lr 0.01 --output-weights final_weights.bin

# 5. Reassemble the trained weights into an ordinary, inference-ready .onnx -- the plain
#    Ort::Session this tool uses has no ExportModelForInferencing equivalent, so this one
#    step stays in Python, the same division of labor the rest of this repo already uses.
python3 scripts/apply_trained_weights.py student.onnx step.onnx.manifest.txt final_weights.bin \
  -o distilled.onnx
```

Building `onnx-finetune-distill-step-graph` needs only `-DORT_HOME=/path/to/a/plain/onnxruntime`
(see "Building onnx-finetune" below) -- unlike `onnx-finetune` itself, it never needs
`ORT_SOURCE_DIR`/`ORT_BUILD_DIR`. The browser has its own runner too, built on the *official*
`onnxruntime-web` npm package rather than a custom Emscripten build: see
`wasm/distill_step_graph/`.

This is a general-purpose classification loss, not tied to any particular architecture --
unlike `examples/llm_distillation/`'s standalone PyTorch/ONNX Runtime Web demos elsewhere in
this repo (a ~1B/~162M-parameter causal-LM pair, and a browser-trained toy Llama respectively),
which distill actual language models. Nothing here requires `torch`/`transformers`, or even a
training-enabled `onnxruntime`: only `onnx` + `numpy` to build the step graph, and a plain
`onnxruntime`/`onnxruntime-web` to run it.

## Federated learning (FedAvg over LoRA, browser clients included)

Train a shared LoRA adapter across several clients that each hold private data, without any
client's data -- or the base model's own weights -- ever leaving where it started. Server-side,
this is `onnxsim.federated`'s FedAvg loop (`onnxsim.federated.run_federated_round`/
`run_federated_training`, exercised in-process by `tests/test_federated.py`): broadcast the
current adapter state, train each client independently, average the results back in. This
section is the client-doesn't-share-a-Python-process version of the same loop --
`scripts/generate_federated_lora_step_graph.py` produces the same kind of step graph
`onnxsim.lora`/the distillation path above already do (forward, LoRA-restricted backward, and an
Adam step baked into one ordinary ONNX graph -- no `onnxruntime.training` anywhere in this path
either), except this one is built *before* any client's data exists, so it can be shipped to and
run entirely inside an untrusted browser tab via the official `onnxruntime-web` package. Only the
trained `lora_A`/`lora_B` values -- a few KB, not the whole model -- ever cross back out of the
client; `scripts/federated_lora_aggregate.py` is the thin CLI wrapper that feeds them into
`onnxsim.federated.fedavg`/`apply_adapter_state` to produce the next round's base model.

```sh
# 1. Any ONNX model with an eligible MatMul/Gemm/Conv weight to adapt -- make_toy_model.py
#    for trying this out without one of your own.
python3 scripts/make_toy_model.py -o base.onnx --hidden-dim 16

# 2. One step graph for this round, at a fixed batch size (unlike the distillation step graph
#    above, this one has no dynamic batch dimension -- see the script's own docstring for why).
#    Also writes step.onnx.base_model.onnx (the deployable, LoRA-injected model), step.onnx.manifest.txt
#    and step.onnx.initial_state.bin -- everything a browser client needs to train, and nothing
#    of this server's own data.
python3 scripts/generate_federated_lora_step_graph.py base.onnx -o step.onnx --batch-size 32 --rank 4

# 3. Each client loads step.onnx + step.onnx.manifest.txt + step.onnx.initial_state.bin via
#    ../wasm/federated_lora/step_graph_runner.mjs (plain onnxruntime-web, no custom WASM build --
#    see that directory's own test for a full worked example) and trains locally on its own
#    private data. What comes back from each client is exportTrainedState()'s output: a small
#    binary file, byte-for-byte the same layout as step.onnx.initial_state.bin.
#      client_a.bin, client_b.bin, ...  (produced in the browser, one per participant)

# 4. FedAvg the clients' updates into the next round's global model. --weight (optional, one per
#    --client) is each client's local example count, i.e. FedAvg proper rather than a plain mean.
python3 scripts/federated_lora_aggregate.py \
  --manifest step.onnx.manifest.txt --base-model step.onnx.base_model.onnx \
  --client client_a.bin --client client_b.bin \
  -o round1.base_model.onnx

# 5. round1.base_model.onnx is an ordinary, inference-ready .onnx (base weights untouched, only
#    the adapter moved) -- and round1.base_model.onnx.initial_state.bin is ready to hand straight
#    back to step_graph_runner.mjs for the next round, no re-derivation needed.
```

What this does *not* add: secure aggregation (the server here sees each client's own update, not
just the sum) and differential privacy are both real requirements for production cross-device FL
and neither is implemented -- `onnxsim.federated.fedavg` is a plain, visible weighted average. See
that module's own docstring for the full scope statement.

## A tiny neural-architecture-search (NAS) search loop, in the browser

Train several candidate architectures on the same problem and pick the one that fits best --
`scripts/generate_nas_step_graphs.py` builds one training-step graph per candidate (a plain
feedforward MLP of a given depth/width, forward + MSE loss + backward + an Adam step, all via
`onnxsim.graph_grad`/`onnxsim.qat_graph`, the same "one ordinary ONNX graph, no
`onnxruntime.training` anywhere" approach the distillation and federated-LoRA step graphs above
use), and `wasm/nas_search/search.mjs` trains each one for the same handful of steps on the same
batch and ranks them by final loss. Every candidate reuses `wasm/federated_lora/
step_graph_runner.mjs`'s `StepGraphSession` unchanged (see that generator's own docstring for why
its manifest format is deliberately identical to the federated-LoRA one) -- including that
runner's own `{ executionProviders: ["webgpu", "wasm"] }` option, so the whole search loop trains
on the browser's own GPU API when one is available, not just wasm's CPU kernels.

```sh
# 1. A small search space of MLP shapes (see generate_nas_step_graphs.py's own SEARCH_SPACE) --
#    each candidate gets its own step.onnx/.manifest.txt/.initial_state.bin, plus one
#    search_space.json listing every candidate this run produced.
python3 scripts/generate_nas_step_graphs.py -o nas_candidates --batch-size 32 --dim 16 --out 8

# 2. Train every candidate and rank them -- see wasm/nas_search/search.test.mjs for a full worked
#    example (`npm install && npm test` in wasm/nas_search/), including a synthetic problem
#    deliberately sized so a low-capacity candidate cannot win no matter how long it trains.
```

Real (browser-verified) WebGPU training for this search loop -- not just the wasm EP the Node
test above exercises -- is proven the same way `wasm/federated_lora`'s own real-browser training
demos are: `scripts/convertmodel/test/webgpu_nas_search.test.mjs` runs the whole search loop in a
real Chromium page via Playwright, checks every op in a candidate's step graph actually placed on
WebGPU (`JsExecutionProvider`), and checks WebGPU and wasm agree on which candidate wins.

What this is not: a real NAS algorithm (no evolutionary search, no reinforcement-learning
controller, no zero-cost proxies) -- just the smallest possible "train several architectures,
compare them" loop, which is also the part any of those would still need at the bottom of their
own search: a way to actually train a candidate and read back a score.

### Ranking by measured latency, not just loss

`search.mjs`'s `trainCandidate` times its own training loop with `performance.now()` and reports
`meanStepMs` alongside the loss trajectory -- a real, measured per-step wall-clock latency on
whatever execution provider that candidate actually ran on, not a predicted or looked-up latency
the way hardware-aware NAS (MnasNet, FBNet, ProxylessNAS) usually scores candidates. `searchArchitectures`'s
optional `latencyWeight` (default 0, i.e. today's loss-only ranking) folds it into the ranking via
`combinedScore = finalLoss + latencyWeight * meanStepMs`, so a slower candidate needs a
proportionally better loss to still win. There is no one "right" weight -- pass whatever trade-off
this search is actually for.

### A DARTS-style differentiable supernet, as an alternative to the discrete search

`scripts/generate_darts_supernet_step_graph.py` builds a *single* step graph implementing Liu et
al.'s DARTS (arXiv:1806.09055) continuous relaxation instead of several discrete candidates: at one
point in the network, three parameter-free candidate operations (`Identity`, `Sigmoid`, and
`Sigmoid` applied twice) are combined as a softmax-weighted mixture, and the mixture weights
(`alpha`) are just one more trainable tensor in the same Adam step every other weight gets --
architecture search that never leaves gradient descent, so there is no discrete search loop to run
at all. Softmax itself is hand-built from `Exp`/`ReduceSum`/`Div` rather than the fused `Softmax`
op, specifically to keep the whole supernet inside the same `onnxsim.qat_graph.EP_FRIENDLY_OPS`
allowlist the discrete search's candidates already stay within.

```sh
python3 scripts/generate_darts_supernet_step_graph.py -o darts_supernet/step.onnx \
  --batch-size 32 --dim 16 --hidden 16 --out 8
```

See `wasm/nas_search/darts_supernet.test.mjs` for a full worked example, including the (measured,
not assumed) synthetic-data tuning needed to make the architecture weights actually separate: on a
purely linear regression target at unit scale, every candidate can approximate a linear map from
Sigmoid's own near-zero near-linear regime, so `alpha` barely moves. Scaling the input up (and
skipping the discrete search's own `1/sqrt(dim)` target normalization) widens the range the network
needs to cover past what a saturating `Sigmoid` can track, and only then does `alpha` reliably drift
toward the unbounded `Identity` branch -- verified against `onnx.reference.ReferenceEvaluator` before
being pinned as this test's own expectation, not assumed from the paper's own motivation for DARTS.

| `--train-input` / `--train-target` | yes | raw binary files -- `--train-input` always float32, `--train-target` float32 unless `--label-dtype int64` |
| `--input-dim` / `--target-dim` | yes | per-sample element counts |
| `--num-samples` | yes | total samples in the input/target files |
| `--output-model` | yes | where to write the fine-tuned inference `.onnx` |
| `--output-names` | yes | comma-separated graph output name(s) of the *original* model |
| `--batch-size` | no (default 8) | |
| `--epochs` | no (default 10) | |
| `--lr` | no (default 1e-3) | |
| `--save-checkpoint` | no | also save the post-training checkpoint (for resuming training later) |
| `--log-every` | no (default 50) | print loss every N steps; 0 disables |
| `--label-dtype` | no (default `float32`) | `int64` for class-index labels (`--loss cross-entropy`) |
| `--intra-op-threads` / `--inter-op-threads` | no (default `0` = ORT default) | cap ORT's thread pools so a co-running camera/ISP pipeline keeps cores |

`onnx-finetune-distill-step-graph`'s own flags are different (no `--artifacts-dir`,
`--input-dim`/`--target-dim`, `--output-names`, or `--label-dtype`) -- see its own `--help` or
the "Knowledge distillation" section above. It additionally accepts
`--no-cache-teacher-logits`, `--teacher-logits-in/--teacher-logits-out`, and the same
`--intra-op-threads`/`--inter-op-threads` -- see "Running on Axera AX650" below.

## Running on Axera AX650

Both binaries run on the AX650's ARM cores with a plain `onnxruntime` build --
no NPU execution provider is linked into the training loop itself, deliberately:
the step graph contains training-only ops (gradient/Adam updates) the NPU cannot
execute, and the NPU needs Pulsar-compiled `.axmodel` files, not plain `.onnx`.
What the NPU *can* do is the frozen teacher forward pass, once, offline:

```sh
# On the AX650 (or anywhere with AxEngineExecutionProvider): run the teacher
# once over the training set and save raw float32 logits
# (num_samples * num_classes, row-major) -- e.g. via pyaxengine.
# Then train with no teacher model at all:
./build/onnx-finetune-distill-step-graph \
  --step-graph step.onnx --teacher-logits-in teacher_logits.bin \
  --train-input train_input.bin --train-target train_labels.bin --num-samples 2048 \
  --batch-size 32 --epochs 20 --lr 0.01 --output-weights final_weights.bin \
  --intra-op-threads 4
```

Without `--teacher-logits-in`, the tool still avoids re-running the teacher every
epoch: logits are computed once up front and cached (`--teacher-logits-out` writes
that cache for reuse; `--no-cache-teacher-logits` restores per-epoch re-inference
for boards too small to hold the `num_samples * teacher_logits_dim` float cache).
`--intra-op-threads`/`--inter-op-threads` (both tools) cap ORT's pools so training
doesn't starve a co-running camera pipeline. `onnx-finetune` additionally trains
the final partial batch now instead of dropping it when `--num-samples` isn't a
multiple of `--batch-size`.

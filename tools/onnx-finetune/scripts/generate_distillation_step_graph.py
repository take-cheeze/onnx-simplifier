"""Build a self-contained knowledge-distillation training-step graph, using
onnxsim's own reverse-mode differentiator (``onnxsim.graph_grad``) instead of
``onnxruntime.training`` -- the only distillation implementation onnx-finetune
has (see ../README.md's "Knowledge distillation" section).

It emits ONE ordinary ONNX model -- forward, KD loss, and backward, plus an
Adam step, all baked into a single graph via
``onnxsim.qat_graph.make_step_graph`` -- runnable by repeatedly calling
``session.Run()``/``InferenceSession.run()`` on a plain (non-training)
session and feeding each step's outputs back in as the next step's weight
inputs. ``onnxsim.lora``/``onnxsim.qat`` already do the same thing for LoRA
and QAT, hand-differentiating with ``onnxsim.graph_grad`` instead of needing
a training-enabled onnxruntime (the ``onnxruntime-training`` PyPI wheel, or a
from-source ``--enable_training_apis`` build for a C++ CLI/WASM binding).

**The loss**, matching Hinton et al.: ``alpha`` * soft-target cross-entropy
(temperature-scaled) + ``(1 - alpha)`` * hard-label cross-entropy. Built from
``onnxsim.qat_graph.GraphBuilder`` primitives rather than the fused
``LogSoftmax``/``SoftmaxCrossEntropyLoss`` ops onnxblock would use, since
neither has a VJP rule in ``graph_grad`` (and this is deliberately not the
place to add one -- see graph_grad.py's own "arithmetic primitives, not
fused ops" stance):

- ``log_softmax(x)`` is ``Log(Softmax(x))`` -- two rules ``graph_grad``
  already has. ``Softmax``'s own max-subtraction happens inside the op for
  numerical stability, so this composition is not less stable than a fused
  LogSoftmax would be for the logit magnitudes a training loop produces.
- picking out each row's target-class log-probability (what
  ``SoftmaxCrossEntropyLoss`` does internally) is a ``Mul`` against a one-hot
  label matrix followed by a ``ReduceSum`` -- both ops ``graph_grad`` already
  differentiates, unlike ``Gather`` (whose rule only covers a single
  constant-axis table lookup, not "row i, column labels[i]" for a batch of
  different columns per row -- see ``graph_grad._grad_gather``'s own
  docstring). The one-hot matrix itself is built on the *host*, from the
  caller's integer labels, and handed in as an ordinary float32 input
  (:func:`labels_to_onehot`) -- turning an integer index into a one-hot row is
  data preparation, not a gradient, and doing it off-graph keeps every node
  ``build_backward`` is asked to differentiate inside ``graph_grad.SUPPORTED_OPS``
  (notably keeping ``Cast``/``Greater``/``Less``, which have no VJP rule, out
  of the differentiated slice entirely).
- the mean over the batch is a ``ReduceSum`` divided by a per-step
  ``batch_size`` scalar input, *not* a ``ReduceMean`` -- see "Dynamic batch
  size" below for why.

**What is different from ``onnxruntime.training.artifacts.generate_artifacts()``'s
output.** That produces four separate artifact files (``training_model.onnx``,
``eval_model.onnx``, ``optimizer_model.onnx``, ``checkpoint``) consumed by
``onnxruntime.training.api``'s stateful ``Module``/``Optimizer``/
``CheckpointState`` objects. This produces one :class:`onnxsim.qat_graph.StepGraph`
(a single ``ModelProto`` plus a ``{input name: output name}`` state map) meant
for :func:`onnxsim.qat_graph.run_step_graph` or a hand-rolled loop -- there is
no separate eval-only graph and no persisted optimizer-state file format; a
caller that wants to pause/resume training saves the state dict's numpy
arrays itself. There is also no ``additional_output_names`` facility here:
only the combined loss is exposed as a step-graph output, not a soft/hard
breakdown.

**Dynamic batch size.** ``graph_grad.build_backward`` needs the static shape
of every tensor the slice touches (undoing a broadcast and undoing a
reduction are both shape arithmetic -- see graph_grad.py's own module
docstring), which sounds like it should force a batch size fixed at graph-
build time, the way a QAT/LoRA step graph's calibration-block shapes are. It
does not, for this graph specifically: every rule the forward+loss actually
reaches (``MatMul``/``Add``/``Mul``/``Div``/``Sub``/``Neg``/``Softmax``/
``Log``/``ReduceSum``/``Transpose``) only ever does *structural* reasoning
about the batch axis (its rank/position, or whether two shapes are equal) --
never numeric arithmetic on its size -- so declaring it as an ONNX
``dim_param`` (a symbolic dimension, the standard way any ordinary model
expresses "batch size is decided at ``Run()`` time") and carrying that
symbol through the shapes dict ``build_backward`` consults works unmodified.

The one place that is NOT true is ``ReduceMean``: its gradient rule bakes
``1 / N`` in as a build-time Python float constant, which cannot exist for a
batch size only known at ``Run()`` time. Rather than change that rule (used
by QAT/LoRA too, where every shape genuinely is static), this loss avoids
ever asking it to differentiate a ``ReduceMean`` over the batch axis: the two
"mean over the batch" reductions are written as ``ReduceSum`` (whose gradient
is the constant 1, independent of ``N``) followed by ``Div`` against a
``batch_size`` per-step scalar input the caller feeds directly -- the same
"push data-dependent bookkeeping that is not really part of differentiation
to the host side" move :func:`labels_to_onehot` already makes for the one-hot
matrix, just for a scalar instead of a matrix.

Only a rank-2 ``(batch, num_classes)`` logits tensor is supported -- the
shape every classifier in this tool's own tests and examples produces. A
higher-rank output (e.g. per-token classification, ``(batch, seq,
classes)``) would need the batch *and* sequence axes both folded into one
dynamic "rows" dimension for the reshape this module used to do in that case,
which needs more than a single ``dim_param`` to express; that combination is
refused with a clear error rather than silently mishandled.

    (the native CLI, see ../src/distill_step_graph_main.cpp, and the wasm
    runner, see ../wasm/distill_step_graph/step_graph_runner.mjs) needs to
    actually run ``step``:

    - ``manifest_path``: a flat, line-oriented text manifest (matching
      ``onnxsim/qat_parity_fixtures.txt``'s own reasoning for the same
      choice -- no JSON parser is vendored here either) naming every
      per-step tensor input, the loss output, and -- the one thing the raw
      ONNX graph itself cannot reveal -- the ``{state input name: state
      output name}`` mapping :class:`onnxsim.qat_graph.StepGraph` carries,
      since ``GraphBuilder``'s own autogenerated output names (``sub_130``,
      not something derivable from the input name) are exactly the point of
      threading state through a step graph rather than mutating it in place.
      A shape entry is either a decimal integer (static) or the literal
      string :data:`DYNAMIC_BATCH` (dynamic, decided per call by the
      caller's own batch) -- readers must treat a non-numeric shape token as
      "substitute the batch size you are actually using this call", not try
      to parse it as an int.
    - ``initial_state_path``: every trainable weight's starting value (from
      the student model's own initializers), concatenated float32,
      row-major, in the same order the manifest's ``weight`` lines list them
      -- everything else in ``initial_state`` (each weight's ``__m``/``__v``
      Adam moments) starts at zero, which the reader can produce itself
      without needing it spelled out here.

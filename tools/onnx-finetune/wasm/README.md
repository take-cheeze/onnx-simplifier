# onnx-finetune-wasm

**Knowledge distillation runs through a completely separate browser runner that avoids
everything in this file's "Status" section below: `distill_step_graph/`.** It runs a step
graph from `../scripts/generate_distillation_step_graph.py` (onnxsim's own graph_grad/qat_graph
autodiff, not `onnxruntime.training`) via the *official* `onnxruntime-web` npm package's plain
`ort.InferenceSession` -- no Embind wrapper, no custom Emscripten build, no
`--enable_training_apis` at all, and it sidesteps the "memory access out of bounds" bug below
entirely (that bug is in a training-op kernel this path never touches). See
`../README.md`'s "Knowledge distillation" section and
`distill_step_graph/step_graph_runner.mjs`/`.test.mjs`. Everything below this point describes
the *other* runner (`src/onnx_finetune_wasm.cpp`, the Embind wrapper around
`Ort::TrainingSession`), which still needs the from-source build, still has this file's own
unresolved memory bug, and has no distillation support of its own at all -- for that, use
`distill_step_graph/` instead.

The step-graph runners (`distill_step_graph/` and `federated_lora/`) default to
onnxruntime-web's wasm (CPU) execution provider. On a desktop browser with a
Vulkan driver, pass `{ executionProviders: ["webgpu", "wasm"] }` to
`StepGraphSession.create` to run the training step graph on WebGPU -- the
browser's own GPU API, which Chromium serves over that Vulkan driver -- with
onnxruntime-web falling back to the wasm CPU kernels for any op WebGPU cannot
run. WebGPU needs a real browser page (`navigator.gpu`), which is why the
wasm default stays put under plain Node.

Same training loop as `../src/main.cpp` (the native CLI), compiled to
WebAssembly and exposed to JS via Embind instead of argv, so it can run
fine-tuning entirely client-side in a browser tab.

## Status

**Build-verified, including WebGPU (JSEP).** `emcmake cmake` + `cmake --build`
against ORT v1.19.2 with `onnxruntime_ENABLE_TRAINING_APIS=ON` and
`onnxruntime_USE_JSEP=ON` (this file's `ONNX_FINETUNE_WASM_WEBGPU` default)
produces a working `onnx-finetune-wasm.js`/`.wasm` (932 build steps,
~11.5 MB `.wasm`). One upstream bug needed a patch to get there --
`patches/mlas-wasm-ort-enforce.patch` (applies to the ONNX Runtime source
checkout, not this repo): `onnxruntime/core/mlas/lib/q4_dq.cpp` (int4
block-quantization kernels, unrelated to anything this tool uses) calls
`ORT_ENFORCE`/`ORT_THROW` unconditionally, but those aren't defined under
`BUILD_MLAS_NO_ONNXRUNTIME`, which the wasm build always sets. Apply it to
your `onnxruntime` checkout before configuring:

```sh
cd /path/to/onnxruntime
git apply /path/to/onnxsim/tools/onnx-finetune/wasm/patches/mlas-wasm-ort-enforce.patch
```

Traced (and confirmed by the successful build) that the training+wasm CMake
wiring itself needed no changes: with `onnxruntime_BUILD_WEBASSEMBLY_STATIC_LIB=ON`,
`bundle_static_library()` in `onnxruntime_webassembly.cmake` produces a real
linkable `add_library(... STATIC IMPORTED)` target, and
`orttraining/training_api/*.cc` is globbed straight into `onnxruntime_session`
(already one of the bundled libraries) by `onnxruntime_session.cmake` -- so
training symbols end up in the archive with no separate training library
needed on the link line.

Build time (4 cores, `-O3`, ORT + onnx + protobuf + abseil all from source):
25m35s cold, 6m41s warm (95.8% ccache hit rate) *if the build directory name
matches between runs* -- generated headers get included via
`-I<build-dir>/onnxruntime-build`, so a differently-named build directory
(e.g. a fresh temp dir per CI run) busts most of ccache's hash and only
saves ~7%. Reuse the same directory name (wipe contents, keep the path) to
get the real benefit; `CCACHE_BASEDIR` does not fix this specific case since
the differing path segment is the directory name itself, not just its
absolute prefix.

**Runtime: partially exercised, currently flaky.** Loaded the compiled
module in Node (bundled with emsdk, not a browser) and ran a real training
loop against the same toy artifacts the native CLI's example uses. First
attempt (historical): the full 20-epoch loop ran and the loss converged
(5.06 -> ~0.00001, matching the native CLI almost exactly) -- genuine
confirmation the training loop executes correctly in wasm -- but
`exportModel()` then failed with an undecodable raw exception pointer
instead of a catchable JS error. Adding `DISABLE_EXCEPTION_CATCHING=0` to
`onnx-finetune-wasm`'s own link flags looked like the fix (that setting
lives on `onnxruntime_webassembly`'s LINK_FLAGS in
`onnxruntime_webassembly.cmake`, which is silently ignored once that target
is a bundled `STATIC IMPORTED` library rather than the final linked module)
-- but `build.ninja` shows the flag was already present globally via ORT's
own wasm CXX flags both before and after that change, so it wasn't actually
the fix.

**Update, from re-testing while adding distillation support:** the earlier
"JSEP/WebGPU EP probing `navigator.gpu`" hypothesis is **ruled out**. A
`-DONNX_FINETUNE_WASM_WEBGPU=OFF` rebuild (no JSEP at all) still fails on
the very first `trainStep()` call -- but now with a real, decodable error
instead of an opaque pointer: `RuntimeError: memory access out of bounds`,
thrown from inside a `dynCall`/`invoke_viiiii` trampoline (an indirect call
into a training-op kernel). Reproduces at the smallest possible scale
(`batch=1`, the plain 2-tensor training path, the exact toy regression
model the README's own example uses) -- not something specific to larger
batches or JSEP. This looks like a genuine wasm32-compiled-kernel memory
bug in this exact onnxruntime v1.19.2 + emsdk 3.1.59 combination, not an
application-level bug in this file or `../src/main.cpp` (both build clean
and are exercised end to end by the *native* CLI without issue).
Root-causing further needs bisecting onnxruntime commits/emsdk versions
with a symbol-level (`-g`) debug build, which is out of scope here;
`.github/workflows/onnx-finetune-training.yml`'s wasm job runs this
anyway (so a future fix shows up as newly-green CI) but doesn't block on
it. Whether it runs correctly in an actual browser (`example/`, untested
either way) is unknown -- Node is where this was reproduced, and there's
no reason to expect a browser's wasm engine to behave differently for a
plain memory-safety bug like this.

## Design

Everything that can avoid touching a virtual filesystem does:
`CheckpointState::LoadCheckpointFromBuffer` and the `std::vector<uint8_t>`
overload of the `TrainingSession` constructor take the four artifact files
directly as bytes, so the JS side just needs `fetch()` + `ArrayBuffer` --
no `FS.writeFile` staging. The one exception is `ExportModelForInferencing`,
which only has a path-based signature upstream in this ORT version; that
single write goes through Emscripten's in-memory MEMFS (never a real disk)
and gets read straight back into a `Uint8Array` to hand to JS.

`FinetuneSession` (Embind class, `src/onnx_finetune_wasm.cpp`) mirrors the
native CLI's loop one-for-one:

| native CLI | wasm binding |
|---|---|
| load artifacts from `--artifacts-dir` | `new Module.FinetuneSession(checkpointBytes, trainingModelBytes, evalModelBytes, optimizerModelBytes)` |
| `--lr` | `session.setLearningRate(lr)` |
| `TrainStep` + loss print | `session.trainStep(inputFloat32Array, targetFloat32Array, batch, inputDim, targetDim)` -> loss |
| `OptimizerStep` | `session.optimizerStep()` |
| `LazyResetGrad` | `session.lazyResetGrad()` |
| `ExportModelForInferencing` + `--output-names` | `session.exportModel(['name1', ...])` -> `Uint8Array` |

Batch construction, shuffling, and the epoch loop live in JS
(`example/app.js`) rather than C++, same division of responsibility as the
native CLI (C++ owns the training step, the caller owns the data loop).

`trainStep`'s `target` always means whatever the training graph's `--loss`
mode expects, marshaled as a `Float32Array` -- there is no int64-label
support in this binding (only `--loss cross-entropy`/distillation artifacts
would need that, and this binding has no distillation mode of its own; see
the top of this file for the separate `distill_step_graph/` runner).

## Building

Requires `emcmake`/`emcc` (from emsdk) and a host `protoc` binary (protobuf's
codegen runs on the host during a cross build, same requirement as
`../../build_wasm.sh` has for onnxsim itself):

```sh
# from an onnxruntime source checkout with training support (same one used
# for the native build, see ../README.md)
PROTOC=$(which protoc)  # or build one, see ../../build_wasm.sh

emcmake cmake -B build \
  -DORT_SOURCE_DIR=/path/to/onnxruntime \
  -DONNX_CUSTOM_PROTOC_EXECUTABLE=$PROTOC \
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build -t onnx-finetune-wasm
```

Output: `build/onnx-finetune-wasm.js` + `build/onnx-finetune-wasm.wasm`.
Copy both into `example/` (or adjust the `<script src=...>` path in
`example/index.html`) to run the demo.

## Trying the example

Generate the same toy artifacts the native CLI's example uses, alongside
`example/`:

```sh
cd example
python3 ../../scripts/make_toy_model.py -o toy_model.onnx
python3 ../../scripts/make_synthetic_data.py --num-samples 2048
PYTHONPATH=/path/to/onnxruntime/build/Release/build/lib \
  python3 ../../scripts/generate_artifacts.py toy_model.onnx -o artifacts
```

Then serve `example/` with any static file server (needs no special
headers -- this build has wasm threads off) and open `index.html`. It
should show the same loss curve as the native CLI's toy example (roughly
5 -> under 0.001 over 20 epochs) and offer a `finetuned.onnx` download at
the end.

## Memory

wasm32's linear memory is capped at 4 GiB (see the `MAXIMUM_MEMORY` comment
in `../../CMakeLists.txt` for onnxsim's own reasoning on this same limit).
Measurements against the native build earlier in this project's history put
full AdamW fine-tuning at roughly 4x a model's raw fp32 weight size in RSS --
so this comfortably covers small-to-medium models (a few hundred million
parameters) but rules out anything approaching billion-parameter scale
in-browser.

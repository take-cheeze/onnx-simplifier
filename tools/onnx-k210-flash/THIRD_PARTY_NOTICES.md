## kflash.py

`web/k210_isp.mjs` is a from-scratch JavaScript port of the ISP flashing
protocol implemented by
[kendryte/kflash.py](https://github.com/kendryte/kflash.py) -- every
constant, packet layout, and control sequence was read out of that
project's `kflash.py` and re-implemented in JavaScript for Web Serial; no
code was copied.

`web/isp_stub.bin` **is** copied, byte-for-byte: it's kflash.py's own
`ISP_PROG` constant (an embedded, zlib-compressed binary), decompressed.
That binary is the "flash mode" firmware the K210's mask-ROM ISP loads into
SRAM and boots into partway through flashing -- the mask ROM itself can
only read/write SRAM, not the SPI flash, so this stub is what actually
implements flash erase/write. There is no source for it beyond the
compiled bytes kflash.py ships, so vendoring those bytes is the only way to
reuse it.

## kendryte-standalone-demo (w25qxx.c / w25qxx.h)

`firmware/runtime/src/w25qxx.c` and `.h` are copied, as-is, from
[kendryte/kendryte-standalone-demo](https://github.com/kendryte/kendryte-standalone-demo)'s
`kpu/` example directory -- the SPI-NOR-flash driver
`firmware/runtime/src/main.cpp` uses to read a kmodel off flash at boot.
It isn't part of the base `kendryte-standalone-sdk` (only this separate
demo repo), and isn't otherwise available as source. Per the files' own

## kendryte-standalone-sdk

`firmware/runtime/prebuilt/onnx-k210-runtime.bin` is built against
[kendryte/kendryte-standalone-sdk](https://github.com/kendryte/kendryte-standalone-sdk)
(Apache License 2.0) -- its `lib/` (drivers, the vendored `nncase` v0/v1
runtime including prebuilt `lib/nncase/v1/lib/*.a`, and `third_party/`
gsl-lite/mpark-variant/nlohmann_json/xtl) links into that binary. The SDK
itself isn't vendored into this repo (see `firmware/runtime/README.md`
for how to fetch it to rebuild); this note covers what ends up compiled
into the committed `.bin`.

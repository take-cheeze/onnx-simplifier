"""MoEQuant (Hu, Chen et al., 2025, ICML 2025, "MoEQuant: Enhancing
Quantization for Mixture-of-Experts Large Language Models via Expert-Balanced
Sampling and Affinity Guidance", https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03804).

Every weight-only quantizer already in onnxsim -- including
:mod:`onnxsim.gptq`, whose Hessian-accumulation and column-update code this
module reuses directly (:func:`onnxsim.gptq._gptq_quantize_columns`) -- treats
calibration data uniformly: run N batches through the model, accumulate
``H = X^T X`` equally from every sample. That is the right assumption for a
plain MatMul/Gemm layer, where every calibration token exercises the same
weight the same way. It breaks down for a Mixture-of-Experts layer's own
per-expert weights (:func:`onnxsim.pruning.apply_moe_expert_channel_pruning`'s
and :func:`onnxsim.pruning.apply_moe_whole_expert_pruning`'s own
``com.microsoft::MoE`` target), because *which* expert a token's activation
actually informs is itself decided by the router, and real routers are
learned, imbalanced, and data-dependent: a handful of popular experts see the
bulk of any calibration set's tokens, while rarer experts see only a trickle
-- sometimes none at all. Naively running :mod:`onnxsim.gptq`-style
calibration once per expert (uniformly over whichever tokens happen to route
there) inherits that imbalance directly into the Hessian: popular experts get
a well-conditioned, plentiful calibration signal, rare experts get a noisy,
near-singular one (or nothing), and the quantization quality gap between them
tracks router popularity rather than the actual reconstruction error each
expert's own weight contributes to the model's output.

This module's own contribution is **not a new quantization algorithm** --
sequential Hessian-compensated column quantization is exactly
:mod:`onnxsim.gptq`'s, reused as-is via a precomputed, per-expert Hessian.
It is a new **calibration methodology**, specific to MoE's sparse,
data-dependent routing, with two distinguishing pieces:

- **Affinity-Guided Quantization (AGQ)**: rather than counting every token
  a router sends to expert ``e`` equally, each token ``t``'s contribution to
  expert ``e``'s own Hessian is weighted by that token's own router
  affinity/gate weight for ``e`` -- ``softmax(router_probs)[t, e]`` --  so a
  token the router is confident about (a high gate weight) counts for more
  than one that only barely qualified into the top-``k`` selection. Applied
  to both of an expert's own weights: ``fc1_experts_weights``' Hessian is
  built directly from ``H``'s own input activation (the MoE node's own
  ``input[0]``, shared -- ungated -- by every expert), and
  ``fc2_experts_weights``' Hessian is built from that same expert's own
  ``fc1``-then-activation output (recomputed here in plain numpy from the
  captured input and ``fc1``'s *own float* weight -- this module quantizes
  each expert's ``fc1``/``fc2`` independently from real activations, the same
  per-candidate independence :func:`onnxsim.gptq.apply_gptq` already uses,
  rather than chaining a quantized ``fc1``'s own output into ``fc2``'s own
  calibration).
- **Expert-Balanced Self-Sampling (EBSS)**: independent of how a token's
  contribution is *weighted*, an expert that a calibration set routes many
  tokens to still ends up with proportionally more calibration influence than
  a rarely-used one -- a *raw-count* imbalance no per-token weighting alone
  corrects (uniformly rescaling one expert's whole Hessian by a constant
  changes GPTQ's optimal-brain-surgeon correction not at all: the column
  update ``H^{-1}[i, j] / H^{-1}[i, i]`` is a ratio, invariant to any uniform
  scale of ``H``). This module's own EBSS step instead *subsamples* an
  over-represented expert's routed-token pool down to a shared, balanced
  per-expert budget (``ceil(tokens * k / num_experts)``, drawn without
  replacement, weighted by each token's own AGQ affinity) before that
  pool ever reaches the Hessian -- a real change to *which* activation
  directions inform that expert's own calibration statistic, not just an
  overall magnitude adjustment. An under-represented expert (at or below the
  shared budget already) is left alone: this module's own EBSS can rebalance
  which of the *already-captured* calibration tokens count towards an
  over-represented expert, but it cannot fabricate calibration coverage a
  rarely-routed expert never received in the first place -- the paper's own
  EBSS instead re-samples/re-runs a live calibration data *loader* until
  every expert clears its own target, which needs repeated fresh forward
  passes this module does not perform. Supplying more/larger calibration
  batches (raising ``num_samples``, or passing real data via
  :func:`onnxsim.load_huggingface_calibration_data`) is this module's own
  route to genuinely more coverage for a rare expert; ``ebss=False`` disables
  the subsampling step entirely (AGQ affinity weighting alone, over every
  routed token) for comparison.

Scope: targets plain ``com.microsoft::MoE`` nodes matched by
:func:`onnxsim.pruning._match_moe_producer` (the exact same matcher
:func:`onnxsim.pruning.apply_moe_expert_channel_pruning` uses -- see that
module's own section comment for precisely which shapes/activations/``fc3``/
``swiglu`` combinations are declined and why), restricted further here to
FLOAT32 ``fc1_experts_weights``/``fc2_experts_weights`` (FLOAT16/BFLOAT16,
which that matcher itself accepts, are left untouched -- the same float32-only
restriction :mod:`onnxsim.gptq`/:mod:`onnxsim.adaround` already carry).
Quantization itself is INT4, block-wise symmetric (this module computes its
own initial round-to-nearest scale the same way
:func:`onnxsim.quantize_weight_only_int4` does -- one scale per 32-element
block of the reduction axis, per output row -- since, unlike
:mod:`onnxsim.gptq`, there is no existing ``MoE``-targeting int4 rewrite to
read a scale back from), but the result is **simulated ("fake") quantization**:
each expert's ``fc1``/``fc2`` float32 initializer is overwritten in place with
its dequantized (``code * scale``) reconstruction, rather than packed into
ONNX Runtime's real quantized ``com.microsoft::QMoE`` contrib op (a
fundamentally different, non-trivial column-packed/scale/zero-point storage
format -- see :mod:`onnxsim.pruning`'s own extensive "QMoE" section comment
for its exact contract). The graph keeps its original ``MoE`` node, dtype, and
shapes, so it stays exactly as loadable/runnable as the input model; emitting
a real ``QMoE`` rewrite (bandwidth reduction, not just simulated precision
loss) is deliberately left as future work, the same kind of documented
scoping decision :func:`onnxsim.pruning.apply_moe_expert_channel_pruning`'s
own section comment already makes for ``fc3``/``swiglu``.

    **Not delegated to the C++ port, deliberately.** Unlike most other
    ``apply_*``/``apply_*_cpp`` pairs in this codebase, this function stays
    its own independent, pure-Python implementation rather than aliasing
    :func:`onnxsim.apply_moequant_cpp` -- the same
    "two independently-correct, non-interchangeable entry points" contract
    ``ApplyQuarot``/``apply_quarot_cpp`` and ``apply_quarot`` already
    establish for their own random-rotation gap (see ``onnxsim.h``'s own
    ``ApplyQuarot`` doc comment). The reason here is EBSS's own weighted-
    without-replacement subsampling: this function's ``_ebss_select`` draws
    from a caller-supplied ``numpy.random.Generator``, while
    ``apply_moequant_cpp`` uses its own independent splitmix64-derived RNG
    (see ``onnxsim/moequant_entry.h``'s own accepted numerical scope note)
    -- aliasing this function to the C++ port would silently change which
    tokens EBSS keeps for every existing caller that relies on this
    function's own reproducible-from-a-numpy-seed behavior (directly, or
    via ``rng`` threaded through other pure-Python callers). Column
    quantization itself (GPTQ's own machinery, reused via
    :func:`onnxsim.gptq._gptq_quantize_columns`) is otherwise the same
    algorithm on both sides -- ``apply_moequant_cpp`` is the faster,
    independently-verified alternative when that RNG difference doesn't
    matter to the caller (e.g. ``ebss=False``, or ``ebss=True`` when only
    the resulting quantization quality -- not which exact tokens were
    kept -- is being compared).

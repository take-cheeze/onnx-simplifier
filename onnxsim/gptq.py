"""GPTQ (Frantar et al., 2022, "GPTQ: Accurate Post-Training Quantization for
Generative Pre-trained Transformers", https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.17323) --
one of the notable weight-only PTQ techniques ``torchao`` implements
(``torchao/prototype/gptq/``, prototype status there; onnxsim ports the
*algorithm*, not that code -- see :mod:`onnxsim.awq`'s own docstring for why:
torchao has no ONNX export path). Third onnxsim-native PTQ technique
alongside :mod:`onnxsim.adaround` and :mod:`onnxsim.awq`, each pulling a
different lever on the exact same target scheme
(:func:`onnxsim.quantize_weight_only_int4`'s block-wise symmetric INT4):
AdaRound jointly optimizes every element's own rounding via gradient
descent; AWQ rescales whole input channels before quantizing; GPTQ instead
quantizes input channels **one at a time**, and after each one, propagates
its rounding error into every *not-yet-quantized* channel so their own
rounding can compensate for it -- a second-order (Hessian-based), greedy but
exact-per-step algorithm, not an iterative optimization.

The mechanism: for a layer's weight ``W`` ([N, K], output channel first) and
its calibration activations ``X`` ([samples, K]), the Hessian of the
layer's own squared reconstruction error with respect to ``W`` is
``H = X^T X`` (a ``[K, K]`` matrix, independent of ``W`` -- every output row
shares the same ``H``). Processing input channels left to right: quantize
channel ``i`` to its nearest grid point (using the same per-block scale
:func:`onnxsim.quantize_weight_only_int4` already computed), then charge the
resulting error to every remaining channel ``j > i`` in proportion to
``H^{-1}[i, j] / H^{-1}[i, i]`` -- the correction an optimal-brain-surgeon-
style argument shows exactly cancels that error's contribution to the
*layer's* reconstruction error, not just channel ``i``'s own. This module
uses the same Cholesky-based reformulation the GPTQ paper itself introduces
for efficiency (one ``H^{-1}`` Cholesky factorization up front, reused via
slicing for every column and block, rather than re-deriving a shrinking
inverse at every step) -- plain numpy, no framework dependency, matching
:mod:`onnxsim.adaround`/:mod:`onnxsim.awq`'s "post-hoc adjustment from real
activations" style.

    MatMul/Gemm/transB-Gemm/biased-Gemm, block sizes, damping levels,
    multi-batch and rank-3 calibration, dead/duplicate channels, and
    every skip shape -- see tests/test_gptq_cpp.py -- before this alias
    was made. (The port's dense inverse/Cholesky use scalar
    double-precision kernels rather than LAPACK; no divergence was
    observed anywhere measured, but see ``gptq_entry.h``'s own accepted
    numerical scope note.) Imported lazily (inside the function body, not
    at module scope) to avoid a circular import:
    ``onnxsim.onnx_simplifier`` already imports from this module, so
    importing it back at module load time here would deadlock the import

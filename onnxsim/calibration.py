"""Calibration data generation and static (calibration-based) quantization.

``onnxsim.quantize_dynamic`` needs no calibration data: it defers the
activation's quantization range to a ``DynamicQuantizeLinear`` computed fresh
on every inference. Static quantization instead *fixes* that range ahead of
time, from representative data -- usually a better trade (no per-inference
range computation) but only as good as the calibration data it is given.

This module provides two calibration data sources, meant to be used in order
as a model moves from a quick smoke test towards real deployment:

- :func:`generate_random_calibration_data` -- synthetic random data. Works
  out of the box with no external dependency or dataset to find, so
  :func:`quantize_static` falls back to it automatically. Good for checking
  the quantization pipeline itself works; a poor proxy for a real model's
  actual activation statistics.
- :func:`load_huggingface_calibration_data` -- real examples pulled from a
  Hugging Face Hub dataset (needs the optional ``datasets`` package). Gives
  calibration ranges that actually reflect deployment-time data, at the cost
  of needing a dataset whose columns can be matched to the model's inputs.

:func:`calibrate` runs the float model over either data source through
ONNX Runtime to produce the ``{tensor_name: (min, max)}`` ranges
:func:`onnxsim.quantize_static` (this module's main entry point) needs.

    2017). Works on ``|values|`` throughout, since a single shared threshold
    only makes sense as a magnitude clip; :func:`calibrate` intersects
    ``[-T, T]`` with the tensor's observed ``(min, max)`` afterwards to get
    the final (possibly asymmetric) range.

    The search: build a fine-grained (``num_bins``) histogram of
    ``|values|``, then for every candidate cutoff ``i`` from the
    ``min_coverage`` percentile's bin up to ``num_bins``, compare the
    reference distribution (the histogram clipped at ``i``, with everything
    beyond folded into the last bin) against a simulated quantization of that
    same clipped range down to ``num_quantized_bins`` levels and back. The
    cutoff with the lowest KL divergence is the threshold that loses the
    least distributional information by quantizing -- often tighter than the
    raw max for a heavy-tailed distribution, where a handful of outliers
    would otherwise stretch the whole range and waste quantization levels on
    rarely-hit values.

    ``min_coverage`` bounds the search from below at that percentile of
    ``|values|`` (default: the top 0.1% may be clipped, no more). Without it,
    the search can pick a pathologically small threshold on data that is
    already smooth (no long tail to reward clipping against, e.g. a raw
    Gaussian): quantizing *any* narrow slice of a locally-flat distribution
    reproduces its shape almost exactly, so KL divergence stays near zero for
    every threshold and the search has nothing to distinguish them by,
    including catastrophically aggressive ones. Real, mostly-heavy-tailed
    activation distributions have plenty of room below this floor for the
    search to still find a genuinely tighter-than-max threshold in.

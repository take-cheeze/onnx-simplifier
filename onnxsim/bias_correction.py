"""Empirical Bias Correction -- the data-driven half of "Data-Free
Quantization Through Weight Equalization and Bias Correction" (Nagel et al.,
2019), also shipped as part of Qualcomm's AIMET toolkit. Its sibling
technique, Cross-Layer Equalization, is :func:`onnxsim.cross_layer_equalize`.

Quantizing a layer's weight is not a zero-mean operation in general: the
rounding error correlates with the weight distribution (e.g. clipped/
asymmetric distributions round more one direction than the other), so a
quantized Conv/Gemm/MatMul's output picks up a systematic *mean* shift per
output channel on top of the expected per-element quantization noise.
:func:`onnxsim.cross_layer_equalize` and every ``quantize_*`` scheme leave
this shift uncorrected -- it is a real, measurable bias, not something
either of them targets. :func:`correct_bias` measures it directly (the
"empirical" variant of the paper's Bias Correction -- the "analytic"
variant, which estimates the same shift from BatchNorm statistics instead
of running real data through the model, is not implemented here) and
cancels it.

The same measurement applies to any output-preserving *algorithm* swap, not
only quantization: e.g. a deployment target whose Resize kernel doesn't
implement every interpolation mode, so onnxsim (or a downstream converter)
rewrites a model's Resize node to a mode the accelerator does support. That
rewrite is exact for some inputs and systematically off for others in a way
that, like quantization rounding, tends to have a nonzero mean per channel
-- ``correct_bias`` treats it identically to a quantized Conv/Gemm/MatMul's
bias shift, measuring and cancelling it the same way. It does not (and
cannot) recover a mode swap's non-systematic, input-dependent error --
that would need real fine-tuning of downstream weights, not a constant
offset.

For every Conv/Gemm/MatMul/Resize node present (by output tensor name) in
both ``float_model`` and ``quantized_model``, this runs both models on the
same calibration data, measures each such layer's own per-output-channel
mean error (``float_output - quantized_output``, independent of any other
layer's correction -- not chained through progressively-corrected
activations), and adds that as a constant per-channel offset right after
the layer in ``quantized_model``. Adding a constant to an affine layer's
output is exactly equivalent to folding it into that layer's bias, whatever
internal shape the ``quantize_*`` scheme that produced it happens to use
(a straight Conv/Gemm/MatMul weight-only rewrite, a multi-node dynamic-
quantization chain, a Resize mode substitution, ...) -- so this needs no
scheme-specific knowledge of where a bias tensor lives internally, only
that the layer's own output tensor kept its original name, which every
onnxsim ``quantize_*`` pass (and any Resize-attribute rewrite that edits
the node in place) guarantees (downstream consumers are never rewired by
name).

A geometric change to Resize (a different ``coordinate_transformation_mode``,
or ``mode`` itself) mostly does *not* fit this model, though: the resampling
error at a given output pixel depends on the local gradient of whatever the
input happens to be at that spatial location, which is roughly as likely to
push the value up as down. Averaged per channel over many differently-
content calibration images, that error washes out to ~0 -- there is no
"channel bias" for :func:`correct_bias` to find, however much calibration
data it is given. What *does* survive averaging is the part of the error
that is consistent by *position* rather than by content: deployments where
the calibration images share spatial structure (a fixed-mount camera, a
consistent framing/crop, a scene layout that recurs across samples --
common in e.g. ADAS/robotics perception pipelines) see the same
misalignment at the same output pixel across samples, which a per-channel
constant still cannot represent but a per-*position* map can.
:func:`correct_spatial_bias` measures exactly that: a coarse per-channel
grid of position-wise mean error, smoothed back up to full resolution. Since
that only helps when the calibration data actually has this shared spatial
structure -- and can otherwise make things measurably worse by fitting
position-wise noise -- it holds out part of the calibration data and only
applies the correction where it verifiably reduces held-out error.

Computational cost: both functions only ever run *forward* inference --
``num_samples`` (default 8 for :func:`correct_bias`, 16 for
:func:`correct_spatial_bias`) forward passes through each of the two
models, no backward pass and no weight updates, so the total cost is
~2x``num_samples`` ordinary inferences plus O(output size) numpy reductions
(negligible next to that). That is orders of magnitude cheaper than actual
fine-tuning (e.g. the LoRA/distillation path in ``tools/onnx-finetune``, or
:func:`onnxsim.apply_block_finetune` with ``teacher_forced_inputs=False``
-- see that function's own docstring), which needs a backward pass and an
optimizer step per batch, repeated over multiple epochs, and a
training-capable ONNX Runtime build -- these functions need neither
gradients nor a training build, only whatever inference backend
:mod:`onnxsim.backend` already uses. The tradeoff is exactly the one
documented above: this cheap path only recovers a systematic (mean, or
spatially-consistent) shift, not the full error a real algorithm change
can introduce.

Measured on a Resize mode swap (``linear`` -> ``nearest``, a genuinely
different resampling kernel, not just a coordinate offset) feeding a small
downstream Conv stack: :func:`correct_spatial_bias` measured ~0% held-out
error reduction regardless of how many trainable layers sat downstream of
the swap, while :func:`onnxsim.apply_block_finetune` with
``teacher_forced_inputs=False`` measured 57-61% -- fine-tuning's advantage
here is not really about being "more powerful" in the abstract, it is that
a trained weight can express an actual function of the distortion, which a
constant or coarse spatial offset structurally cannot, whatever data it is
fit on. **A held-out validation pass is not a correctness guarantee against
a distribution the validation itself did not cover.** Measured on the same
swap moved earlier in the network (two more Conv+ReLU stages between the
correction point and the model's own final output): the correction *passed*
its own internal held-out check (a split of the same calibration data) and
still made a separately-generated held-out set's error ~2.5% worse -- more
downstream nonlinearity between where the correction is measured and where
the task's own error is ultimately judged apparently weakens how well an
in-distribution validation split predicts true out-of-distribution
behavior. The gate makes this a no-op in the common case, not a guarantee
against every case; a caller with production-representative calibration
*and* validation data (rather than one calibration set internally split)
gets a meaningfully stronger check than the built-in default.

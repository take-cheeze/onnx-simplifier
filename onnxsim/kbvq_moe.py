"""KBVQ-MoE (Xu et al., 2026, ICLR 2026, "KBVQ-MoE: KLT-guided SVD with
Bias-Corrected Vector Quantization for MoE Large Language Models",
https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11184). onnxsim ports the algorithm -- the
paper's own reference code (https://github.com/xuzukang/kbvq_moe) trains
against live PyTorch MoE modules, with no ONNX export path, the same
rationale as :mod:`onnxsim.gptq`/:mod:`onnxsim.awq`.

A Mixture-of-Experts layer routes the *same kind* of token to many
structurally-similar experts, so a router group's own ``E`` expert weight
matrices end up highly cross-expert redundant: much of what any one
expert's weight encodes, some linear combination of the others already
encodes too. Every MoE-aware or vector-quantization scheme already in
onnxsim leaves that redundancy completely unexploited:

- :mod:`onnxsim.moequant`'s own contribution is a **calibration
  methodology** for MoE's sparse, data-dependent routing (Affinity-Guided
  Quantization + Expert-Balanced Self-Sampling feeding an ordinary
  per-expert :mod:`onnxsim.gptq` pass) -- it does not change *how* an
  expert's weight is represented relative to its siblings at all; each
  expert is still quantized as if it were an unrelated standalone layer.
- :mod:`onnxsim.kmeans_quantization`'s own codebook is fit *per layer*,
  independently -- run on each expert of a router group one at a time
  (exactly what this module's own baseline comparison in its test suite
  does), it re-fits, and re-pays the storage cost of, a fresh codebook
  for every expert's own copy of the group's shared structure.
- :mod:`onnxsim.low_rank_compensation`'s own SVD is of a single quantized
  layer's own error matrix (``float_weight - dequantized_weight``),
  fit and applied strictly *within* that one layer -- it never looks at,
  or shares a basis across, any other layer's weight at all.
- :mod:`onnxsim.bias_correction`'s own per-channel correction targets one
  ordinary Conv/Gemm/MatMul layer's own quantization-induced output mean
  shift. It has no notion of several already-lossy layers being summed
  together afterwards -- exactly what a token's top-``k`` selected
  experts' own outputs are, in every ``com.microsoft::MoE`` node this
  module (and :mod:`onnxsim.moequant`) targets -- so it cannot see, or
  correct for, quantization bias that MoE's own gated aggregation
  amplifies across several experts at once.

KBVQ-MoE's own contribution is a genuinely different **weight
representation** for a router group's experts, not a different
calibration recipe or a single-layer correction:

- **KLT-guided shared basis.** Flatten each of a router group's ``E``
  expert weight matrices (``fc1_experts_weights``/``fc2_experts_weights``,
  handled independently) into one length-``D`` vector, stack them into an
  ``[E, D]`` matrix, and take the Karhunen-Loeve Transform (KLT, i.e. PCA)
  of that stack: the top-``rank`` eigenvectors of the ``E`` experts' own
  ``D x D`` covariance matrix, computed here via one compact SVD of the
  *centered* ``[E, D]`` stack itself (:func:`_klt_basis`) -- numerically
  the same eigenvectors a direct eigendecomposition of the ``D x D``
  covariance would give (right singular vectors of centered data are that
  matrix's own eigenvectors), but never forming the far larger ``D x D``
  matrix explicitly, the same closed-form-SVD style
  :mod:`onnxsim.low_rank_compensation` already uses. This basis is fit
  **once per router group** and shared by construction -- every expert's
  own dominant, cross-expert-redundant component is represented by the
  same handful of basis vectors, not re-encoded from scratch per expert.
- **Per-expert residual vector quantization.** Each expert's own
  projection onto the shared basis (``shared_e = mean + coeff_e @
  basis``) is subtracted from its float weight, and only the
  *residual* -- whatever the shared basis does not already capture -- is
  vector-quantized with an ordinary k-means codebook, reusing
  :mod:`onnxsim.kmeans_quantization`'s own Lloyd's-algorithm fitting
  routine (:func:`onnxsim.kmeans_quantization._kmeans_1d`) directly,
  applied to each expert's own flattened residual instead of its raw
  weight.

Composing these two pieces is the whole point: the shared component
(the expensive-to-represent-per-expert part, since it is what makes the
experts *alike*) is paid for once per router group, while VQ -- already
the tightest-fitting codebook representation onnxsim has for a
single tensor's own value distribution -- is spent only on each expert's
own genuinely idiosyncratic remainder. See this module's own test suite
for a direct, numerical demonstration that this beats running
:mod:`onnxsim.kmeans_quantization` independently per expert at a matched
total bit budget, on a router group constructed to have real shared
structure.

Scope: like :mod:`onnxsim.moequant`, this targets ``com.microsoft::MoE``
nodes matched by :func:`onnxsim.pruning._match_moe_producer` (reused,
unmodified, via :func:`onnxsim.pruning._find_moe_chains`), restricted to
FLOAT32 ``fc1_experts_weights``/``fc2_experts_weights``. Also like
:mod:`onnxsim.moequant`, the result is **simulated ("fake") quantization**:
each expert's weight is overwritten in place with its dequantized
(shared-basis-reconstruction plus dequantized-residual) value, so the
graph keeps its original ``MoE`` node, dtype, and shapes -- no new
storage-packed op. The paper's own **channel-wise affine output bias
correction** -- compensating for how MoE's gated aggregation amplifies
several already-lossy experts' own individual quantization bias into a
larger aggregate bias at the ``MoE`` node's own output, a distinct
correction target from :mod:`onnxsim.bias_correction`'s own per-layer one
(see above) -- is deliberately left out of this module's own scope, the
same kind of documented simplification :mod:`onnxsim.moequant`'s own
docstring makes for a real ``QMoE`` rewrite: a natural, self-contained
follow-up built the same way :func:`onnxsim.bias_correction.correct_bias`
already measures a per-channel correction from calibration data, applied
at the ``MoE`` node's own output instead of a plain layer's.

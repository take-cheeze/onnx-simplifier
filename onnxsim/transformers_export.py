"""Export a Hugging Face ``transformers`` model straight to a simplified
ONNX deployment directory.

onnxsim has no PyTorch tracing code of its own, and does not need any: turning
a ``transformers`` model into an ONNX graph is exactly what Hugging Face's own
``optimum`` package already does, for every architecture that has an
``optimum.exporters.onnx`` ``OnnxConfig`` (hundreds of model types, including
the split multi-file encoder/decoder-with-past shape autoregressive
generation needs -- see ``tests/test_optimum_export_deploy.py``). That export
is deliberately plain -- no runtime-specific op fusion -- so there is real
simplification left on the table for onnxsim's own pipeline to find.

This is a different tool for a different job than ONNX Runtime GenAI's own
model builder (``onnxruntime_genai.models.builder``): that one covers a fixed,
curated list of decoder-only causal-LM architectures, and its output is
already fused/quantized into ORT-specific ops (e.g. ``com.microsoft::
MatMulNBits``, ``GroupQueryAttention``) meant to be consumed directly by ORT
GenAI's own generate() loop -- there is little left for a generic simplifier
to do to it, and it does not cover encoder-only, seq2seq, vision, or audio
architectures at all. ``optimum``'s export is the right shape for *this*
job instead: a plain graph, for any architecture with an ``OnnxConfig``,
handed to onnxsim to clean up.

:func:`export_transformers_model` wraps exactly the manual
export-then-simplify-then-copy-the-rest recipe
``tests/test_optimum_export_deploy.py`` exercises by hand, as a reusable
onnxsim entry point.

    ONNX via ``optimum.exporters.onnx.main_export``, then simplify every
    ``.onnx`` file it produces, in place, inside ``output_dir``.

    Needs the optional ``torch``, ``transformers``, and ``optimum`` (with the
    ``optimum-onnx`` distribution installed for ``optimum.exporters.onnx``)
    packages -- heavy, and unrelated to onnxsim's own ONNX-to-ONNX pipeline,
    so they are not normal onnxsim dependencies
    (``pip install onnxsim[transformers]``).

    :param model_id: Hugging Face Hub model id or local model directory
    :param output_dir: directory to export into. Also where the simplified
            files end up: each exported ``.onnx`` file is overwritten in
            place with its simplified version. Non-``.onnx`` files (tokenizer,
            config, ...) are left untouched, so the directory stays
            deployable exactly like a plain ``optimum`` export.
    :param task: the export task, e.g. ``"text-generation-with-past"`` or
            ``"text2text-generation-with-past"``; ``"auto"`` (the default)
            lets ``optimum`` infer it from the model's config.
    :param no_post_process: keep a multi-file encoder/decoder(-with-past)
            export split rather than merged into a single graph with an
            ``If``-node branch switch. Defaults to ``True``: as of this
            writing, simplifying a merged decoder produces a model that
            fails at runtime (see ``tests/test_optimum_export_deploy.py``'s
            docstring for the specific failure) -- the split shape simplifies
            and reloads correctly, and ``optimum``'s own runtime classes
            (e.g. ``ORTModelForSeq2SeqLM``) fall back to it automatically
            when no merged file is present.
    :param check_n: forwarded to :func:`onnxsim.simplify` for every exported
            graph -- how many random-input runs to check the simplified
            model against the freshly exported one for numerical equivalence.
    :param save_as_external_data: always save every simplified graph with its
            weights in a companion ``<filename>.data`` file, instead of
            inline. On by default here -- unlike the ``onnxsim`` CLI's own
            ``--save-as-external-data``/plain ``onnx.save``, which default off
            and only use external data as a fallback once a graph is too
            large to serialize inline at all (>2GB) -- because a real
            (non-tiny) transformers with-past export is the common case this
            function exists for, and it is multiple *independent* graphs
            (encoder/decoder/decoder-with-past, see ``no_post_process``
            above), each embedding its own full inline copy of whatever
            weights it uses -- e.g. the decoder's weights end up duplicated
            across ``decoder_model.onnx`` and ``decoder_with_past_model.onnx``
            -- and every pass in onnxsim's own optimization pipeline that
            touches the graph (shape inference, checker, each fixed-point
            round) copies those inline bytes along with it. External data
            keeps the large tensors on disk instead, so this repeated
            in-memory copying and the inline duplication across split files
            both shrink to metadata (name/offset/length) rather than the
            tensors themselves. Pass ``False`` to keep small/tiny models
            (tests, toy checkpoints) as a single self-contained ``.onnx``
            file with no companion ``.data``.
    :param export_kwargs: extra keyword arguments forwarded to
            ``optimum.exporters.onnx.main_export`` (e.g. ``opset``,
            ``device``, ``fp16``, ``trust_remote_code``).
    :param simplify_kwargs: extra keyword arguments forwarded to
            :func:`onnxsim.simplify` for every exported graph.
    :returns: ``{filename: check_ok}`` for every ``.onnx`` file exported,
            where ``check_ok`` is that file's :func:`onnxsim.simplify`
            numerical-equivalence check result (always ``True`` when

    """Export a decoder-only causal-LM ``transformers`` model to a *fixed*-size
    ("static") KV cache ONNX pair -- ``prefill.onnx`` (variable prompt length,
    empty cache) and ``decode.onnx`` (one new token, cache already partly
    filled) -- then simplify both.

    This is a different shape than :func:`export_transformers_model`'s
    ``optimum``-based export, on purpose. ``optimum``'s
    ``decoder_with_past_model.onnx`` grows its ``past_key_values``/``present``
    tensors by one position every decode step (a `Concat`), which means every
    single-token decode step reallocates and copies the *entire* cache seen
    so far -- O(n) work per step, O(n^2) over a full generation. The ONNX
    ``TensorScatter`` op (opset 24) exists specifically to let backends avoid
    that: write each new token's K/V into a pre-allocated
    ``(batch, heads, max_cache_len, head_dim)`` buffer in place, O(1) per
    step. But ``optimum``'s own export can't be rewritten into that shape
    after the fact -- HF's modern causal-mask construction
    (``transformers.masking_utils``) derives the mask's own size from the
    cache's *real* valid length, which is exactly the cache's *tensor* length
    for a growing cache, but silently wrong once the tensor is a fixed-size
    buffer with a smaller amount of real content (confirmed empirically: a
    post-hoc ``Concat``->``TensorScatter`` graph rewrite hits an ONNX Runtime
    broadcast error deep in the mask math).

    The fix is to control the export instead of patching its output:
    ``transformers.StaticCache`` (built for ``torch.compile``/``torch.export``)
    already allocates fixed-size buffers and already gets the mask math right
    -- its ``get_mask_sizes()`` reports the *buffer's* length, not the real
    valid count, which is exactly the missing piece. Tracing a
    ``StaticCache``-based forward pass turns its ``index_copy_`` cache update
    into ``ScatterND`` (not ``TensorScatter`` -- PyTorch's exporter doesn't
    know about the new op, and doesn't need to: ``ScatterND`` is the same
    "overwrite, no reduction" semantics and already runs everywhere). Verified
    against the standard ``optimum`` export: identical greedy-decoded tokens
    over a multi-step generation, via a real ``onnxruntime.InferenceSession``
    for both.

    Needs the optional ``torch`` and ``transformers`` packages (``pip install
    onnxsim[transformers]``) -- unlike :func:`export_transformers_model`, this
    does NOT go through ``optimum``: ``StaticCache``-based tracing is driven
    directly against the ``transformers`` model here, since integrating a
    custom fixed-buffer cache into ``optimum.exporters.onnx``'s own
    per-architecture ``OnnxConfig``/dummy-input-generator machinery is a much
    larger, more architecture-specific undertaking than tracing the model
    directly.

    Scope: decoder-only causal LMs with **uniform, full (non-sliding-window,
    non-hybrid) attention across every layer** -- this wrapper feeds a single
    ``max_cache_len`` to every layer via ``StaticCache``, which allocates a
    (possibly different) ``StaticSlidingWindowLayer`` per layer for hybrid
    architectures (e.g. Gemma 2/3's alternating local/global attention); this
    function does not attempt to distinguish or size those layers separately.
    Encoder-decoder/seq2seq models remain :func:`export_transformers_model`'s
    job -- their cross-attention KV cache doesn't grow at all (computed once
    from the encoder), so it never had this problem in the first place.

    :param model_id: Hugging Face Hub model id or local model directory.
    :param output_dir: directory to export into (``prefill.onnx``,
            ``decode.onnx``, plus tokenizer/config files).
    :param max_cache_len: fixed KV-cache buffer length. Must be at least as
            large as the longest prompt plus the number of tokens you intend
            to generate -- there is no bounds checking at runtime (writing
            past the end wraps around via ``TensorScatter``/``ScatterND``'s
            own modulo-free overwrite semantics, silently corrupting the
            cache instead of erroring).
    :param max_prompt_len: largest prompt length ``prefill.onnx`` accepts
            (a dynamic axis up to this bound). Defaults to ``max_cache_len``.

"""Reverse-mode automatic differentiation over a slice of an ONNX graph, with
the gradient itself emitted as ordinary ONNX nodes.

:mod:`onnxsim.qat_graph` explains why a training step can run on an inference
runtime at all: a hand-derived backward pass is plain dataflow, so it is
expressible as an ordinary ONNX graph and therefore runs wherever an ONNX
model runs -- CUDA/ROCm (including MIGraphX), an NPU execution provider,
WebGPU in the browser. This module removes the "hand-derived" part of that sentence.

**Why that matters.** Every gradient in this repo today is written out by
hand, once per pass, for one fixed expression:
:func:`onnxsim.adaround._build_rounding_step_graph` is twenty lines of
carefully transcribed chain rule for *one* layer's reconstruction error. That
scales as long as the forward is a single MatMul, and stops scaling the
moment it is not -- which is exactly the wall :mod:`onnxsim.brecq` documents
in its own docstring: its block discovery recognizes only a **linear chain**
of MatMul/Gemm layers with no normalization or activation node in between,
because every additional op shape would mean another hand-derived backward.
Block-wise QAT (``docs/qat.md``, deliverable B) needs the gradient of a real
transformer block -- MatMuls, a GELU, a residual Add, a Softmax -- against
its own output, and nobody should transcribe that by hand.

So: given the block's forward nodes, walk them in reverse, and for each one
append the nodes computing its vector-Jacobian product. The output is more
ONNX nodes in the same :class:`onnxsim.qat_graph.GraphBuilder`, so the result
composes with :func:`onnxsim.qat_graph.adam_update` and
:func:`onnxsim.qat_graph.make_step_graph` exactly as a hand-derived gradient
does, and reaches the same execution providers.

**What this is not.** It is not an autograd framework: there is no tape, no
``Tensor`` wrapper, no ``Gradient`` operator, and no runtime involvement --
differentiation happens once, at graph build time, and what ships is an
inference graph. It is also deliberately incomplete: a rule exists for the
ops a quantization-reconstruction block is made of
(:data:`SUPPORTED_OPS`), and an op without a rule raises
:class:`UnsupportedOpError` rather than being approximated or skipped. That
conservative boundary is the same one :mod:`onnxsim.pruning` and
:mod:`onnxsim.finetune` draw: refusing a case is recoverable, silently
emitting a wrong gradient is not -- it shows up as a model that trains to a
slightly worse answer, which is nearly impossible to attribute after the
fact.

**Extending the boundary: :func:`register_gradient`.** A caller whose block
contains an op none of the builtin rules cover -- a custom domain op, or a
standard one this module has not grown a rule for yet -- can hand it one
directly, the same relationship :func:`torch.autograd.Function.backward` (or
more recently ``torch.library.register_autograd``) has to a custom torch op:
write the vector-Jacobian product once, register it against the op type, and
every caller that differentiates through :func:`build_backward` with its
default ``rules=None`` -- which is every public onnxsim entry point that
trains a block (:func:`onnxsim.apply_qat`, :func:`onnxsim.train_lora`, ...) --
picks it up with no further plumbing. Registration is process-global and
Python-only: it has no counterpart in ``graph_grad.h``/``.cpp`` (the
hand-ported C++ mirror the browser/WASM converter path uses), whose rule
table is a fixed, parity-pinned function-pointer map baked in at compile
time -- see :func:`register_gradient`'s own docstring for what that means
for a block trained both ways.

**The one subtlety worth naming up front: broadcasting.** ``Add``, ``Mul``,
``Div`` and friends broadcast their inputs numpy-style, and the gradient of a
broadcast is a *sum* over the axes that were broadcast. A rule that returns
the incoming gradient unchanged for ``[4, 3] + [3]`` produces a ``[4, 3]``
gradient for a ``[3]`` parameter; ONNX will happily carry that shape
mismatch into the optimizer, where it broadcasts again and updates the
parameter with four times the intended step. Every rule here therefore
routes each contribution through :meth:`_Backward.reduce_to`, and
``tests/test_graph_grad.py`` tests broadcasting shapes on their own.

Everything is float32 at opset 17 / IR version 8 -- the pairing
:mod:`onnxsim.qat_graph` already builds and the accelerator backends already
run.

# be avoided by dividing a ``ReduceSum`` by a constant, but ``Sqrt`` could
# not, so contorting one of the two to keep the set at its old size would buy
# nothing.

# ``Gather`` was admitted for :func:`_grad_conv`, and is the one member here
# that is not arithmetic. It is also not a loosening: it was already in
# :data:`onnxsim.qat_graph.EP_FRIENDLY_OPS` -- the note beside that set is
# where its coverage was established, and the same note now records what a
# ``Conv``/``ConvTranspose`` membership would have cost instead. The use is
# the same shape as the minibatching one it was admitted for there: a single
# axis, a constant int64 index, and no dependence of the *index* on any
# runtime value.

# :func:`_grad_batch_normalization` and :func:`_grad_instance_normalization`
# needed nothing from this set at all: every op their gradients use --
# ``Sub``, ``Div``, ``Mul``, ``Add``, ``Sqrt``, ``Reshape`` (for the

# and ``Neg`` -- was already here for :func:`_grad_layer_normalization` or the
# elementwise rules. Worth recording precisely because it is the exception to
# every other note in this block, which each admitted one specific op for one
# specific rule.

# ``Identity`` was admitted for :func:`_grad_add_templated`. A hand-written
# rule that is a pure alias never emits a node at all (see
# :func:`_grad_identity`'s own "an alias, not a node" comment) -- it just
# returns an existing tensor's name -- but a *templated* rule's identity case
# (``GradAdd``'s ``da = db = g``, see
# scripts/codegen/generate_grad_templates.py) is compiled to an ONNX
# ``FunctionProto``, whose declared outputs onnxscript can only produce via an
# actual node, even when that node's whole job is to copy its input. Not a
# coverage gap: ``Identity`` is a plain copy with no arithmetic of its own --
# about the least a WebGPU/WebNN/NPU execution provider could fail to implement --
# and qat_entry.cpp's own choice to route around it elsewhere (renaming a
# tensor instead of emitting an ``Identity`` for it) was about avoiding a
# needless node, not about ``Identity`` lacking backend support.

def _grad_conv(ctx: _Backward, node: onnx.NodeProto, g: str) -> List[Optional[str]]:
    """``Conv``'s three gradients, without emitting a convolution.

    **Why not a convolution.** ``dX`` is naturally a ``ConvTranspose`` and
    ``dW`` a ``Conv`` over permuted axes, and neither operator is in
    :data:`onnxsim.qat_graph.EP_FRIENDLY_OPS`. Putting them there would have
    bought a rule that is dead on the very backends the allowlist exists for
    as soon as the convolution is not 2-D -- the note beside that set records
    what WebNN and onnxruntime-web's WebGPU backend actually implement. So
    this rule takes the other road: the im2col identity, which needs nothing
    the allowlist does not already have.

    **The identity.** Write the forward as a matrix product. With ``t``
    ranging over the kernel's taps and ``o`` over the output positions,

    .. code-block:: text

        col[c, t, o] = X[c, position(o, t)]      (im2col: one gather)
        Y[m, o]      = sum_{c, t} W[m, c, t] * col[c, t, o]

    which is a plain ``MatMul`` of ``W`` reshaped to ``[M, C*K]`` against
    ``col``. Differentiating a matrix product is the rule
    :func:`_grad_matmul` already implements, so::

        dW[m, c, t] = sum_o dY[m, o] * col[c, t, o]        (a MatMul)
        dcol[c, t, o] = sum_m W[m, c, t] * dY[m, o]        (a MatMul)
        dX = col2im(dcol)                                  (a scatter-add)

    and the last line is the only awkward one, because a scatter-add is not
    an operator here. It does not have to be: for a *fixed* tap, ``position``
    is injective -- input element ``p`` is read by at most one output
    position -- so col2im rearranges into a sum of ``prod(kernel)`` gathers
    of ``dY`` (:func:`_col2im_indices`), which is again one ``Gather`` and
    one ``MatMul``. Both directions are therefore the same three nodes:
    gather, mask, matmul.

    **Padding and stride, as a mask.** A tap that reads outside the input
    (padding) or an input element a strided tap never touched has no
    correspondent, and ONNX's ``Gather`` refuses an out-of-range index rather
    than producing a zero. Those entries are pointed at element 0 and
    multiplied by a 0/1 constant instead -- the same "a mask is a float 0/1,
    multiplied in" convention :class:`onnxsim.qat_graph.GraphBuilder` uses
    everywhere else. It is emitted unconditionally, even for a geometry whose
    mask is all ones, so that the two implementations of this rule cannot
    disagree about when to branch.

    **Groups** cost nothing extra: the group axis is split out of the channel
    axis by the reshapes that are already there, and the ``MatMul`` batches
    over it. The same is true of the number of spatial dimensions, which this
    rule never looks at beyond building the index tables -- a 1-D or 3-D
    convolution differentiates exactly like a 2-D one.

    **What it costs.** The two index tables are ``prod(kernel) *
    prod(output spatial)`` and ``prod(kernel) * prod(input spatial)``
    elements, materialized as initializers. That is the price of not needing
    a convolution kernel on the backend, and on a large feature map it is
    megabytes per node: a 3x3 convolution over 224x224 carries ~3.6 MB of
    int64 index and ~1.8 MB of mask. Reconstruction blocks are small and this
    is bounded and predictable, but it is real, and it is the reason this
    rule would not be the right one for a general-purpose trainer.

    sum. Batch and channel are flattened into one axis throughout (called
    ``planes`` below) since neither this rule nor the index tables it uses
    ever need to tell them apart.

    **The divisor.** With ``count_include_pad=1``, or no padding at all, every

    """``MaxPool``'s gradient: route ``dY`` to whichever input element each
    window's max came from.

    A ``MaxPool`` with the optional ``Indices`` output present is never
    reached here at all -- ``build_backward`` refuses any node with more than
    one declared output before a rule ever runs, which is exactly right for
    this one: computing a gradient *for* ``Indices`` (an integer tensor) does
    not make sense, and this rule does not need ``Indices`` to compute
    ``dX`` regardless, so nothing is lost by that refusal covering it too.
    ``GlobalMaxPool`` is a different op type with no rule registered, so it
    is refused the ordinary way. Neither is a design compromise here -- see
    :func:`build_backward`'s single-output check and :data:`SUPPORTED_OPS`.

    **No fresh ``ReduceMax``.** The forward already computed the window's max
    as ``node.output[0]``; recomputing it (besides needing an op outside
    :data:`BACKWARD_OPS`) would be redundant. Instead each window's input
    elements are gathered the way :func:`_grad_conv`'s ``dW`` half gathers
    ``X`` -- one ``Gather`` with :func:`_im2col_indices`'s constant index
    table -- and compared against the broadcast ``Y`` for that window with
    the two comparison ops this module already has::

        eq = (1 - Cast(Greater(gathered, Y))) * (1 - Cast(Less(gathered, Y)))

    which is 1 exactly where ``gathered`` equals ``Y`` and 0 elsewhere -- no
    ``Equal`` needed. A tap the padding invented is masked out unconditionally
    afterwards (its gathered value is an arbitrary element, which could
    spuriously equal ``Y``), the same "gather from element 0, multiply the
    invented ones away" convention :func:`_grad_conv` uses.

    **Ties.** More than one input element exactly equal to a window's max is
    a measure-zero event for real (or randomly generated) float data, but a
    rule that assumed it away would misbehave silently the one time it
    happens. So each window's ``eq`` mask is divided by its own tie count
    (``ReduceSum`` of ``eq`` over the tap axis, always >= 1 since ``Y`` is
    that window's max) before being multiplied by the incoming gradient --
    the same "split the credit" choice :func:`_grad_clip` documents for a
    value sitting exactly on a bound, made here so that a window's total
    outgoing gradient sums to exactly the ``dY`` that came in regardless of
    how many elements tie.

    **The scatter.** Unlike :func:`_grad_conv`'s ``dX`` (whose gathered value
    is the same for every tap, since the weight does the differentiating),
    here each tap's credited gradient genuinely differs per tap, so the plain
    :func:`_col2im_indices` trick -- gather the same ``[planes, out_count]``
    tensor for every tap -- does not apply as-is. Each tap's slice is instead
    given its own offset into a flattened ``[taps, out_count]`` axis (tap
    ``t``'s block starts at ``t * out_count``) so one ``Gather`` still reaches
    the right tap's own contribution for every input element, then a
    ``ReduceSum`` over the tap axis sums however many windows each input
    element belonged to -- the same shape of "sum via gather, not scatter"
    identity :func:`_col2im_indices`'s own docstring explains.

    """``BatchNormalization``'s five gradients, in inference mode.

    A step graph never runs this op with ``training_mode=1``: this repo's
    fine-tuning graphs fake-quantize and reconstruct against *fixed* running
    statistics, they do not re-estimate a mean and variance from the current
    minibatch the way live training would. A ``training_mode=1`` node is
    refused anyway, but not by a check in this rule -- the spec requires it
    to have three outputs (``Y``, ``running_mean``, ``running_var``), so
    :func:`build_backward`'s own single-output check refuses it before this
    rule ever runs, the same way :func:`_grad_maxpool`'s docstring explains
    ``MaxPool``'s optional ``Indices`` output needs no rule-specific check of
    its own. What is left, at the opset-17 default (``training_mode``
    omitted or 0), is per the spec::

        xc   = x - mean            inv = 1 / sqrt(var + eps)
        xhat = xc * inv            y   = xhat * scale + B

    with ``mean``/``var`` the node's own *inputs* -- fixed per-channel
    numbers, not reductions of ``x``. That is the whole difference from
    :func:`_grad_layer_normalization`: there, ``mean``/``var`` are computed
    from ``x`` itself, so every output element's gradient depends on every
    other element through them; here they do not depend on ``x`` at all, so
    differentiating through them is nothing more than differentiating
    through two more per-channel constants, each appearing exactly where the
    forward above shows::

        dx     = g * scale * inv
        dscale = sum_{n, spatial} (g * xhat)
        db     = sum_{n, spatial} g
        dmean  = -sum_{n, spatial} (g * scale * inv)  = -sum_{n, spatial}(dx)
        dvar   = -0.5 * sum_{n, spatial} (g * scale * xc * inv^3)
               = -0.5 * sum_{n, spatial} (dx * xhat * inv)

    the last two reusing ``dx`` (``g * scale * inv``, already needed for
    ``x``'s own gradient) and ``xhat`` (already needed for ``dscale``)
    instead of recomputing either -- ``dx * xhat`` alone is only ``inv^2``
    (one factor from each), so ``dvar`` needs one more multiply by ``inv``
    to reach the ``inv^3`` the chain rule through ``sqrt`` actually produces.

    **The broadcast.** ``scale``, ``B``, ``mean`` and ``var`` are all
    ``[C]`` and broadcast against axis 1 specifically, not against ``x``'s
    trailing axes the way :meth:`_Backward.reduce_to` (built for ordinary
    numpy-style broadcasting -- every ``Add``/``Mul``/``Sub`` rule's own
    case) undoes. Reshaping ``scale`` and ``mean`` to ``[1, C, 1, ..., 1]``
    once, up front, turns their use in the forward arithmetic above into an
    ordinary broadcast; going the other way, the four channel-shaped
    gradients are each one ``ReduceSum`` over every axis but 1 with
    ``keepdims=0``, producing the ``[C]`` shape directly -- the same move
    :func:`_grad_conv` makes for its own bias gradient, generalized from
    "batch and the spatial axes" to "every axis but the channel one", which
    is also right when there are no spatial axes at all (``x`` rank 2, just
    batch and channel): the reduction is then over the batch axis alone.

    """``Gather``'s gradient: a scatter-add into ``data``, ``indices`` itself
    untouched.

    This is the embedding-lookup case -- ``Gather(table, token_ids)`` -- not
    the constant-index-table use :func:`_grad_conv` makes of the *forward*
    ``Gather`` op (see the note above :data:`BACKWARD_OPS`, which is a fact
    about what the rules may *emit*, not about what they can differentiate).
    Here ``indices`` is a real, run-time-valued tensor and ``data`` is the
    thing being trained, so the direction of travel is the opposite one.

    **Why a scatter-add, and why a one-hot matmul instead.** ONNX's
    ``Gather`` reads ``N = data.shape[axis]`` rows and can read the same row
    more than once (a repeated token in a sequence); the gradient of a
    duplicated read is the *sum* of every place it was read, i.e. exactly a
    scatter-add of ``dY`` into ``dData`` at each row ``indices`` named. There
    is no scatter op in :data:`BACKWARD_OPS`, and there should not need to
    be: the same accumulation is a matrix product against a one-hot matrix,
    built from ops already there --

    .. code-block:: text

        onehot[l, n] = 1 if indices[l] == n else 0     (Greater/Less/Cast/Sub)
        dData[n, ...] = sum_l onehot[l, n] * dY[l, ...]  (a MatMul)

    ``onehot == 1`` is built the same two-sided way every other rule here
    builds a boolean without an ``Equal`` node: ``(1 - (idx > n)) * (1 - (idx
    < n))``, with ``idx`` cast to float and broadcast against a constant
    ``arange(N)``.

    **Shape handled.** ``data`` has ``axis`` picking out one of its axes
    (``data: [..., N, ...]``); everything before it flattens to a batch
    dimension ``pre`` and everything after to ``post``, so the one-hot
    ``MatMul`` is ``[1, N, L] x [pre, L, post] -> [pre, N, post]`` -- the same
    "leading 1 broadcasts across a batch axis" trick :func:`_grad_conv` uses
    to keep every operand inside the rank a batched ``MatMul`` wants.
    ``indices`` itself must be rank 0 (a single scalar lookup) or rank 1 (a
    sequence of lookups, ``L`` of them) -- squarely the embedding-lookup
    shape. A higher-rank index tensor (batched lookups, e.g. ``[batch,
    seq]``) is the same idea with an extra flatten/unflatten, but is refused
    here rather than risked: a wrong reshape there would not fail loudly, it
    would silently mix gradients across batch elements. Negative ``axis`` and
    negative index *values* (``indices[i] + N`` per the ONNX-13 spec) are
    both resolved -- the axis at build time, the values in the graph itself,
    since they are only known at run time.

    **What it costs.** The one-hot matrix is ``L x N`` -- the number of
    lookups times the *entire* size of the gathered axis, not just the rows
    actually read. For a small reconstruction block's embedding table this is
    fine; for a large vocabulary (tens of thousands of rows) times a long
    sequence it is a lot of both compute and a materialized ``arange``
    constant, in exactly the same "real, and the reason this rule would not
    be the right one for a general-purpose trainer" way :func:`_grad_conv`'s
    own docstring is upfront about for its index tables.

    **What this does not do.** Differentiating a ``Gather`` node makes its
    contribution to a block *differentiable* -- a block containing an
    embedding lookup no longer has to be routed around. It does not by itself
    make the embedding table a *trained* weight: the block-fine-tuning weight
    finders in :mod:`onnxsim.qat` (the ``MatMul``/``Gemm``/``Conv``-only
    finder and :func:`onnxsim.qat._plan_trained`) still only recognize those
    three op types' weight inputs. Teaching them to also recognize
    ``Gather``'s ``data`` input as trainable is separate, out-of-scope
    follow-up work.

    ``reshape(x, tmp_shape)`` -> ``transpose(., perm)`` -> ``reshape(.,

    C/bs^2, H, W]`` and permutes to ``[0, 3, 4, 1, 5, 2]``. Since a
    ``Reshape``'s adjoint is a ``Reshape`` back to the original shape and a
    ``Transpose``'s adjoint is a ``Transpose`` by the inverse permutation

    reshape to ``x``'s own shape -- is ``DepthToSpace``'s exact adjoint.
    Verified directly: a real ``onnxruntime``-executed `DepthToSpace` node
    dot-product-tested against this formula (`sum(g * y)`'s gradient via
    finite differences) agrees to `5.7e-4` (`eps=1e-3` central-difference
    tolerance), not merely derived from the spec text -- the same
    "checked, not assumed" discipline `unroll_lstm`/`unroll_gru`'s own
    gate-order verification used, warranted here too since a permutation
    this easy to get subtly backwards (as `GRU`'s own `linear_before_reset`
    convention was) would fail silently, not loudly.

    """``Split``'s gradient, as one ``MatMul`` per output against a constant
    0/1 selection matrix -- not a ``Concat`` of the incoming gradients, even
    though that is the textbook VJP of a split-along-an-axis.

    **Why not Concat.** It is not in :data:`BACKWARD_OPS` (this module's own
    WebGPU/WebNN/NPU-portable op allowlist -- see that set's own comment),
    and adding an op there is a real, separately-justified decision (see the
    ``Conv``/``ConvTranspose`` note beside :data:`onnxsim.qat_graph.EP_FRIENDLY_OPS`
    for the shape that justification takes) this rule does not need to
    force, because the same result is reachable with what the allowlist
    already has.

    **The identity.** Move the split axis to the last position (a
    ``Transpose``, skipped when it is already there) and "insert output
    ``i``'s gradient at its own offset in a zero tensor the width of the
    input" becomes "right-multiply by a constant selection matrix": for
    output ``i`` with ``k_i`` entries starting at offset ``o_i`` (out of the
    input's full width ``N`` along that axis), that matrix is ``E_i =
    eye(N)[o_i : o_i + k_i, :]``, because ``g_i @ E_i`` places ``g_i``'s
    ``k_i`` columns at columns ``[o_i, o_i + k_i)`` of an ``N``-wide result
    and zero elsewhere -- exactly Split's adjoint (Split is a linear
    projection; this is that projection's transpose). Outputs accumulate by
    ``Add``; an output with no incoming gradient (nothing downstream needs
    it) simply contributes no term rather than an explicit zero, which is
    cheaper and still correct since ``Add`` needs nothing from a term that
    was never there. The final ``Transpose`` (skipped under the same
    condition as the first) restores the original axis order. Only
    ``Transpose``/``MatMul``/``Add`` are used, all already in
    :data:`BACKWARD_OPS` -- the same "arithmetic primitives, not fused ops"
    discipline :func:`_grad_conv`'s own docstring states directly.

    This is a :data:`MultiOutputRule`, not a :data:`Rule` -- ``Split`` is the
    one op type in :data:`_MULTI_OUTPUT_RULES` rather than :data:`_RULES`,
    which is where :func:`build_backward` looks first (see that function and
    :data:`_MULTI_OUTPUT_RULES`'s own comment for why).

    Geometry comes from each output's own *declared shape* (``ctx.shape``)
    rather than parsing ``Split``'s ``split``-as-attribute (opset <13),
    ``split``-as-optional-second-input (opset 13-17) or ``num_outputs``
    attribute (opset 18+) spellings -- the same "derive from what the graph
    actually says the shapes are, not from re-deriving the attribute that
    produced them" discipline :func:`_conv_geometry`/:func:`_pool_geometry`
    already use for exactly this reason (a misread attribute cannot survive
    to become a wrong gradient), and it means this one rule needs no opset
    branching at all.

    Only ``node.input[0]`` (the tensor actually split) ever gets a gradient;
    an optional second ``split`` sizes input (opset 13+) is an integer list,
    not a function of anything float, the same "no gradient for a shape/axes
    operand" convention every other rule with a non-differentiable extra
    input already follows (``Reshape``'s ``shape``, ``Gather``'s ``indices``).

    **What it costs.** Each ``E_i`` is ``k_i * N`` elements, materialized as
    a constant initializer -- small for a modest channel-axis split (the
    Conformer GLU gating this rule exists for splits one axis of a few
    hundred channels into two), real and bounded for a very wide one, the
    same cost :func:`_grad_conv`'s own index/mask tables carry and document
    for the identical reason: no scatter op is in :data:`BACKWARD_OPS`, so a
    constant selection stands in for one.

#
# :data:`Rule` (and therefore :data:`_RULES`/:data:`SUPPORTED_OPS`) assumes
# exactly one incoming gradient per node -- true of every builtin rule this
# module has ever needed until now, and load-bearing elsewhere:
# ``tests/test_qat_parity.py`` pins ``sorted(SUPPORTED_OPS)`` byte-for-byte
# against a checked-in fixture that also has to match ``qat_entry.cpp``'s own
# hardcoded C++ rule table -- see :data:`SUPPORTED_OPS`'s own comment. A rule
# for an op with more than one *output* (``Split`` and inference-mode
# ``Dropout`` today; GLU gating in a Conformer-style audio-model block, see
# ``docs/axera-audio-speech-op-coverage.md``) genuinely needs a different
# argument shape (one gradient per output, not one), so it is kept in this
# separate table rather than forced into :data:`_RULES`'s contract or
# :data:`_CUSTOM_RULES`'s (which promises the *single-output* :data:`Rule`
# signature to anything that reads it, e.g. a future caller iterating
# ``_CUSTOM_RULES.values()`` expecting to call each with one ``g``).
#
# The direct consequence: an op registered here is **not** part of
# :data:`SUPPORTED_OPS` and has **no C++/WASM mirror** -- differentiating it
# is a Python-only capability today, the same divergence
# :func:`register_gradient`'s docstring already warns ``override=True``
# causes for a *builtin* op, just reached by a different door. It *is*
# visible through :func:`supported_ops`, so QAT/LoRA block discovery
# (``onnxsim.qat.discover_qat_blocks``/``onnxsim.lora.discover_lora_blocks``,
# both already keyed off ``supported_ops()`` rather than the raw constant)
# correctly treats a block containing it as differentiable.

# --- Templated rules ---------------------------------------------------
#
# An alternative to hand-transcribing a rule's graph construction directly in
# Python (and, separately, a second time in graph_grad.cpp): author the rule
# once in onnxscript, compile it offline to a checked-in ONNX FunctionProto
# (scripts/codegen/generate_grad_templates.py ->
# onnxsim.graph_grad_templates_gen), and instantiate the same text from
# either language via ONNX's own function-inlining machinery. onnxscript
# itself is never imported here -- only onnx.parser, already a base
# dependency, to read the checked-in text back into a FunctionProto.
#
# "Add" and "BatchNormalization" were a proof of concept (see
# tests/test_graph_grad_templates.py, which checks GradBatchNormalization
# against torch.autograd) before graduating to production; :data:`_RULES`
# below now also wires every elementwise/broadcasting rule whose forward op
# is in BACKWARD_OPS's coverage already and whose VJP needs no dtype-specific
# node of its own -- Neg, Exp, Sqrt, Log, Sigmoid, Tanh, Erf, Mul, Div -- the
# same way. Each hand-written `_grad_*` above is no longer reachable through
# :data:`_RULES`, but is kept, deliberately, as an independent reference
# implementation: tests/test_graph_grad_templates.py still cross-checks every
# templated rule's numbers against its hand-written counterpart on the same
# inputs, which is exactly the kind of regression check that caught this
# repo's own dvar-derivation bug in the first place and would otherwise be
# lost by deleting the hand-written code. Left hand-written: `_grad_sub` (its
# only "arithmetic" is a single ``Neg``, applied after ``reduce_to`` rather
# than before so it runs on the smaller, already-reduced tensor -- an
# ordering a template called *before* the reduction would lose), `_grad_relu`
# (its mask ``Cast``'s target dtype has to stay a visible, mutable node for
# onnxsim.compile_training._cast_backward_to_fp16 to retarget before
# inlining -- see generate_grad_templates.py's own comment on this), and
# every rule whose core math is inseparable from shape/attribute resolution
# (`Conv`, `Gemm`, pooling, `Reshape`/`Transpose`, the reductions, the
# normalizations, ...).

    the same one :func:`torch.autograd.Function.backward` has to a custom
    torch op: write the vector-Jacobian product once, register it, and every
    later differentiation of that op type uses it with no further plumbing.

    Works as a decorator::

        @graph_grad.register_gradient("MyCustomOp")
        def _grad_my_custom_op(ctx, node, g):
            ...

    ``rule`` must match :data:`Rule`'s signature -- ``(ctx, node, g) ->
    List[Optional[str]]``, exactly what a builtin rule in :data:`_RULES`
    looks like; see any of them (``_grad_relu`` is the simplest) for the
    shape of ``ctx`` (a :class:`_Backward`, offering ``ctx.b`` -- the
    :class:`onnxsim.qat_graph.GraphBuilder` to append new nodes to -- plus
    ``ctx.shape``/``ctx.reduce_to``/``ctx.int64_const`` and friends).
    :func:`build_backward` asserts the returned list is the same length as
    ``node.input``; nothing here can check that in advance since it would
    mean calling the rule speculatively.

    Refuses to silently replace an existing rule -- builtin or a previously
    registered custom one -- unless ``override=True``, the same "a surprising
    collision is refused, not resolved by whichever registration happened to
    run last" stance :class:`UnsupportedOpError` itself takes toward an
    unrecognized op. Overriding a *builtin* op's rule changes differentiation
    for Python callers only: it has no effect on the C++/WASM path (the
    browser QAT/LoRA panels), whose step graphs come from ``qat_entry.cpp``'s
    own hardcoded, unregistrable rule table -- so a block containing that op
    type will train differently in the browser than it does here, a real and
    easy-to-miss divergence worth thinking twice about before reaching for
    ``override=True`` on anything already in :data:`SUPPORTED_OPS`.

    Global and *not* automatically cleaned up -- a test that registers a rule
    and does not call :func:`unregister_gradient` (or use
    :func:`custom_gradient` instead) leaves it registered for every test that
    runs afterward in the same process. Prefer :func:`custom_gradient` for

    The forward slice is differentiated by walking it backwards: each node's
    rule turns the gradient of its output into gradients of its inputs, and a
    tensor read by several nodes collects the sum of their contributions
    (which is the chain rule for a value used more than once -- a residual
    connection's own input being the case that matters here).

    Nothing is added to the forward graph, and no forward node is modified:
    the rules read the forward tensors by name, including node *outputs*
    where reusing them is cheaper than recomputing (``Sigmoid``, ``Tanh``,
    ``Exp``, ``Sqrt``, ``Softmax``). So the caller must place these nodes
    after the forward ones in the same graph, and keep the forward
    intermediates available -- which for a step graph they always are, since
    it is one graph evaluated once.

    :param b: the builder to append gradient nodes to. Passing the same
            builder the forward was built with is the normal case; the point
            is that the result composes with
            :func:`onnxsim.qat_graph.adam_update` and
            :func:`onnxsim.qat_graph.make_step_graph`.
    :param nodes: the forward nodes to differentiate, topologically ordered
            (the order they appear in a valid ONNX graph). Nodes outside the
            slice -- everything upstream of its inputs, everything downstream
            of where ``grad_outputs`` starts -- must not be included.
    :param shapes: the static shape of every tensor the slice touches, its
            inputs and outputs included. ``onnx.shape_inference.infer_shapes``
            on the forward model is the usual source.
    :param grad_outputs: ``{forward tensor name: tensor holding dL/d(that
            tensor)}``, the seed of the backward pass -- typically the single
            output of the block, with the gradient of the reconstruction loss
            against it. Seeding an *intermediate* tensor is allowed and adds
            to whatever the slice itself contributes to it, which is what an
            auxiliary loss on an intermediate activation means.
    :param targets: the tensors to return gradients for -- the parameters
            being trained, and any activation whose gradient the caller wants
            to propagate further.
    :returns: ``{target name: the tensor holding its gradient}``. A returned
            name may be one of ``grad_outputs``' own values when the path is
            a pure alias (a lone ``Identity``), so it is not guaranteed to be
            produced by a node in ``b``.
    :raises UnsupportedOpError: for a node this module will not
            differentiate. It is raised for *every* node in the slice with an
            unknown op type, including one no gradient reaches, so a caller
            learns the slice is out of scope from the shape of the graph
            rather than from whether a particular seed happened to reach it.
    :raises ValueError: if a target is not reachable from ``grad_outputs``
            through ``nodes`` (a disconnected target almost always means the
            slice or the target list is wrong, and a zero gradient would hide
            it), or if a shape is missing from ``shapes``.
    :param rules: replaces the *entire* rule table this call uses, bypassing
            :func:`register_gradient` registrations altogether. Exists for
            :mod:`tests.test_graph_grad_templates`, which builds a copy with

            :data:`_RULES` uses by default, as an independent numeric

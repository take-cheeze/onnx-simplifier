"""llama.cpp's IQ4_NL -- the simplest of GGUF's "I-quant" family: a fixed,
non-uniform 16-entry lookup table ("codebook") used for 4-bit weight-only
quantization instead of a uniform, evenly-spaced 4-bit grid. Code ``c in
[0, 15]`` decodes to ``codebook[c] * block_scale``, with one scale per
32-element block -- quantizing means, per block: pick ``scale =
max(|block|) / max(|codebook|)``, then snap every element to whichever of
the 16 ``codebook[i] * scale`` values is numerically closest. Neural
network weights are typically close to normally distributed, and (the same
motivation as :mod:`onnxsim.nf4`'s own NF4 codebook) a *uniform* 4-bit grid
wastes resolution on the tails while under-resolving the dense region near
zero where most of the weight mass sits -- a fixed, distribution-matched,
non-uniform codebook fixes that without needing any per-tensor calibration.

**Codebook provenance -- an honesty note, per this repo's own established
norm (see e.g. :mod:`onnxsim.gguf_kquant`'s own docstring) against shipping
recalled/assumed numeric constants without verifying them
computationally.** Before writing this module, this repository's own GGUF
decoding code was searched for an existing, already-verified IQ4_NL
codebook to reuse: ``onnxsim/gguf_reconstruct.py`` and
``onnxsim/ggml_kquant.h`` (which decodes Q4_K and the rest of the K-quant
family Q4_K_M/Q4_K_S already import) were checked, along with a
whole-repository, case-insensitive grep for ``"IQ4_NL"`` and
``"kvalues_iq4nl"`` (llama.cpp's own name for its I-quant codebook
constant). **Neither turned up anything** -- this repository decodes
K-quants, not any I-quant format, and has no ``kvalues_iq4nl`` table
anywhere to transcribe from or cross-check against, unlike Q4_K's decoder
(which *was* available to verify against). llama.cpp's real IQ4_NL
codebook could only otherwise come from this module's own recalled/trained
knowledge of that constant -- exactly the kind of unverified numeric claim
this repo's own precedent (and the task this module was written under)
says not to ship.

So: **the 16 values below are NOT llama.cpp's own ``kvalues_iq4nl``
table.** They are this module's own, independently and *computationally*
derived 16-level non-uniform codebook: a generalized Lloyd-Max
(a.k.a. Lloyd's algorithm / 1-D k-means) scalar quantizer, run to
convergence against a standard normal distribution via numerical
quadrature over a fixed, dense grid (deterministic -- no random sampling
involved, so it is exactly reproducible, not just "a plausible-looking
number"). :func:`_lloyd_max_gaussian_codebook` below *is* that derivation
-- the algorithm, not a hardcoded magic array -- and
``IQ4_NL_CODEBOOK``'s 16 literal values are simply that function's own
output, computed once (Lloyd-Max convergence takes a few hundred
iterations over a 200001-point grid, a few seconds -- too slow to redo on
every import) and pasted in below; ``tests/test_iq4_nl.py`` re-invokes
:func:`_lloyd_max_gaussian_codebook` directly and checks it reproduces
these exact literals, so nothing here is an unverifiable claim. A
by-construction Lloyd-Max quantizer against a Gaussian source is *provably*
a locally-optimal (minimum mean squared error) 16-level non-uniform
codebook for that distribution, and empirically -- see this module's own
test file -- it comfortably beats a naive uniform 4-bit quantizer on
Gaussian-ish data, which is the entire point of a "non-linear" codebook in
the first place. It is very likely qualitatively similar in shape to
llama.cpp's real table (both are 16-level, symmetric-ish, denser near zero
codebooks fit to a roughly-Gaussian weight distribution) but is not claimed
to be, and should not be assumed to be, numerically identical to it.

Like :mod:`onnxsim.nf4`, :mod:`onnxsim.gguf_kquant`, and every other
weight-only PTQ module in this repo with a fixed or self-derived codebook,
no ONNX tensor type below INT4 exists to store a genuine 4-bit code
natively next to a non-uniform-codebook dequantization op (ONNX has no such
op at all), so -- following the exact pattern
:func:`onnxsim.apply_gguf_q4_k_quantization` already established for Q4_K
-- this module represents the result as a plain float32
quantize-dequantize round trip folded directly into a new initializer (no
new graph nodes), rather than :mod:`onnxsim.nf4`'s alternative of building
the codebook lookup out of ordinary ``Gather``/``Reshape``/``Mul`` ops.

**Scope**: matches ``MatMul``/"vanilla" ``Gemm`` (via
:func:`onnxsim.llm_int8._match_matmul_like`, shared with several other
onnxsim modules) and, optionally, ``Conv`` -- any constant float32 weight,
of any rank, is flattened, zero-padded up to a whole number of 32-element
blocks, quantized, and reshaped back; padding elements are quantized along
with the rest but discarded before reshaping, so they cannot affect the
tensor's real values (a padding element is always exactly 0, which can
never be a block's own largest-magnitude element unless the whole block is
already all-zero, so padding cannot even change a boundary block's own
chosen scale). No calibration data is needed -- like NF4 and Q4_K, every
quantization decision comes from the weight tensor's own values.

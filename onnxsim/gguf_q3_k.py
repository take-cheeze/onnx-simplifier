"""llama.cpp's GGUF "Q3_K" K-quant format -- the block layout behind the
``Q3_K_S``/``Q3_K_M``/``Q3_K_L`` quantization presets, the family's
smallest-per-element member (roughly 3.4 bits per weight once its scale
table is amortized). Joins :mod:`onnxsim.gguf_kquant` (Q4_K) and
:mod:`onnxsim.gguf_q6_k` (Q6_K) as this repo's third member of the K-quant
family proper -- distinct from the plainer
:mod:`onnxsim.gguf_legacy_quant` (Q4_0/Q4_1, one flat scale per block, no
super-block) and :mod:`onnxsim.iq4_nl`/:mod:`onnxsim.gguf_ternary_quant`
(a fixed codebook or ternary code, not a re-quantized affine scale).

onnxsim already *reads* Q3_K when importing a GGUF checkpoint -- see
``onnxsim/ggml_kquant.h``'s ``DequantizeQ3_KBlock`` (and its
``UnpackQ3KScales`` helper), which this module's own dequantization math
is deliberately kept consistent with (the same "verified against this
repo's own existing decoder" discipline :mod:`onnxsim.gguf_kquant`'s own
docstring already documents). What has been missing is the encoder
direction.

**Q3_K's block structure**: a 256-element super-block is split into 16
sub-blocks of 16 elements. Each sub-block gets its own 6-bit unsigned
scale code ``sc_j`` (``[0, 63]``), made signed by a fixed ``-32`` offset;
one shared float16 super-block scale ``d_all`` multiplies that offset code
to give the sub-block's own effective scale. Structurally this is Q6_K's
shape -- a *single* shared super-block reference (no separate
``d``/``dmin`` pair as in Q4_K/Q5_K/Q2_K) times a signed per-sub-block
scale code times a signed element code, with no zero-point subtraction
anywhere -- just with a much coarser element code:

    dequant = d_all * (sc_j - 32) * q,   q in [-4, 3],   sc_j in [0, 63]

The element code ``q`` is where Q3_K differs from every sibling: a real
Q3_K block stores 2 low bits per element plus one bit per element in a
separate 32-byte high-bit mask, and ``DequantizeQ3_KBlock`` combines them
as ``low - (hmask_bit_set ? 0 : 4)``, so the effective code range is the
**asymmetric** 8-value set ``{-4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3}``. That
asymmetry (one more level below zero than above, rather than Q6_K's
symmetric ``[-32, 31]``-style split around it) is the real format's own
documented behaviour, not a transcription error here -- it is exactly what
this repo's own already-verified decoder computes.

**Honesty note**: as with :mod:`onnxsim.gguf_kquant`'s and
:mod:`onnxsim.gguf_q6_k`'s own encoders, this module does **not** reproduce
the real format's on-disk bit-packing -- neither the 12-byte packed
6-bit-scale array (``UnpackQ3KScales``'s own bit-twiddling) nor the
2-bit-plus-separate-high-bit-mask element layout. Following this repo's
established convention for every K-quant encoder, only the *reconstructed
float32 values* are produced, folded directly into a new initializer (ONNX
has no tensor type below INT4, let alone Q3_K's own fractional packed
storage, so there is no packed binary layout to target either way).

What is verified here is the *dequantization* formula above (matching this
repo's own already-verified decoder). llama.cpp's own *encoder*,
``quantize_row_q3_K`` -- its exact procedure for choosing each sub-block's
ideal scale and requantizing it to 6 bits -- was not available to read
alongside the decoder, so the specific per-sub-block-scale/per-element
quantization procedure below is this module's own straightforward,
honestly-scoped design, not a transcription of it. It is "verified" only
in the sense that it reproduces the format's documented reconstruction
*shape*: one shared float16 super-block scale, 16 per-sub-block scale
codes (restricted to non-negative offset codes, see next paragraph), and
the asymmetric 8-value element range -- checked with real numpy arithmetic
in this module's own test file, ``tests/test_gguf_q3_k.py``, not against
recalled or assumed constants.

The encoder, per sub-block ``j`` of 16 elements:
``ideal_scale_j = max(|sub_block_j|) / 4`` (4 being the larger-magnitude
side of the asymmetric ``[-4, 3]`` code range), then per super-block
``d_all = max_j(ideal_scale_j) / 31`` (rounded to float16, as a real
``.gguf`` file stores it) and ``sc_j = 32 + clip(round(ideal_scale_j /
d_all), 0, 31)``. The ``31`` rather than ``63`` is deliberate: like
:mod:`onnxsim.gguf_q6_k`'s own encoder -- which only ever produces
non-negative codes for its own signed scale field -- this encoder restricts
itself to ``sc_j in [32, 63]``, i.e. ``sc_j - 32 in [0, 31]``, so a
sub-block's effective scale is always non-negative. It uses half of the
raw type's range, and is called out here rather than left implicit.

**Scope**: matches ``MatMul``/"vanilla" ``Gemm`` (via
:func:`onnxsim.llm_int8._match_matmul_like`) and, optionally, ``Conv`` --
any constant float32 weight, of any rank, is flattened, zero-padded up to
a whole number of 256-element super-blocks, quantized, and reshaped back.
No calibration data is needed.

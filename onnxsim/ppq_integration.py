"""Optional bridge to PPQ (OpenPPL's PyTorch Post-Training Quantization
framework, https://github.com/OpenPPL/ppq -- ``pip install ppq``), for
calibration-based static quantization via PPQ's own calibration/observer
algorithms and quantization scheduler instead of onnxsim's own
:func:`onnxsim.quantize_static`.

**PPQ itself appears unmaintained and is confirmed broken against any
current environment (see below) -- for a PPQ-API-shaped interface that
actually works today, with no PPQ install at all, prefer
:mod:`onnxsim.ppq_compat` instead of this module.** This module remains
for whoever specifically needs real PPQ's own dispatch/optimization
machinery in an environment where its incompatibilities have been
separately worked around.

**Confirmed, not speculative: the latest PyPI release (``ppq==0.6.6`` at the
time this was written) cannot be imported at all in an environment with the
modern ``onnx``/``protobuf`` versions onnxsim itself requires.** Verified by
directly attempting the import in this repo's own dev environment -- two
independent, unrelated failures, either one fatal on its own:

1. ``import ppq`` -> ``TypeError: Descriptors cannot be created directly.``
   from ``ppq/parser/caffe/ppl_caffe_pb2.py`` -- that file is protoc-
   generated code frozen against a pre-3.19 ``protobuf`` runtime API; modern
   ``protobuf`` (needed by current ``onnx``/``onnxruntime``, both already
   onnxsim dependencies) rejects it outright.
2. Even with ``PROTOCOL_BUFFERS_PYTHON_IMPLEMENTATION=python`` set to work
   around (1): ``ppq/parser/onnx_parser.py`` does ``from onnx import
   helper, mapping, numpy_helper`` -- ``onnx.mapping`` was removed from the
   public ``onnx`` package (renamed internal to ``onnx._mapping``) in a
   version newer than PPQ has ever been updated against.

So this module's ``PPQ_AVAILABLE`` will be ``False`` in any environment
that also has a current ``onnx`` installed -- which, since onnxsim itself
requires one, means essentially always right now. **The integration code
below is written directly against PPQ's real, documented top-level API
(``ppq.api.quantize_onnx_model``/``export_ppq_graph``, read from the
installed package's own source) but has NOT been executed end to end in
this session, because PPQ cannot be imported to run it against.** Treat it
as a best-effort bridge for whoever runs this in an environment where PPQ's
own incompatibilities have been worked around (e.g. a separate, older-
``onnx``/``protobuf`` virtualenv) -- not as confirmed-working code the way
the rest of this project's claims are.

PPQ's own quantization execution is PyTorch-based (it JIT-traces the ONNX
graph through its own ``TorchExecutor``, not onnxruntime), so this needs a
real ``torch`` install too, on top of ``ppq`` -- both optional, checked
lazily, same graceful-degradation convention as
``scripts/axera/pulsar2_quantizer.py``'s onnxruntime dependency.

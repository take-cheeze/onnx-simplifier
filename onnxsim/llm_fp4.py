"""LLM-FP4 (Liu, Yuan, Yang, Cheng, Yang, Liu, Zhu and Xu, 2023, EMNLP,
"LLM-FP4: 4-Bit Floating-Point Quantized Transformers",
https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16836). onnxsim ports the algorithm, not any
framework's code, per the same rationale as :mod:`onnxsim.smoothquant`/
:mod:`onnxsim.zeroquant`.

**Relationship to onnxsim's other 4-bit floating-point modules.** onnxsim
already has two other 4-bit *floating-point* codebook formats:
:mod:`onnxsim.mx_quantization` (MXFP4: fixed E2M1 elements, per-block scale
restricted to a **power of two**, per the OCP MX spec) and :mod:`onnxsim.nf4`
(NormalFloat4: a fixed, data-*independent* 16-value codebook fit to a
standard normal distribution's own quantile points, not a sign/exponent/
mantissa format at all). LLM-FP4 is neither: it is a **standard**
sign/exponent/mantissa FP4 format (like MXFP4's own E2M1), but

1. its per-block scale is an ordinary **real-valued** float, not restricted
   to a power of two (MXFP4's own restriction), and
2. it does not fix the exponent/mantissa bit split at E2M1 -- it **searches**
   a small set of splits (this module: E1M2, E2M1, E3M0 -- every way to
   divide FP4's 3 non-sign bits between exponent and mantissa) per tensor,
   picking whichever minimizes reconstruction error, rather than using one
   format for every tensor unconditionally.

Both properties come from the paper's own "pre-shifted exponent bias"
framing: for a *floating-point* quantizer (unlike an affine INT4 quantizer),
the per-block scale and the format's own exponent bias are two names for the
same real-valued degree of freedom -- multiplying a block by ``2^d`` before
quantizing to a fixed-bias FP4 codebook is identical to quantizing the
unscaled block against a codebook whose bias has been shifted by ``d``. This
module realizes that freedom directly as a per-block real-valued scale (the
same representation :mod:`onnxsim.nf4` already uses for its own non-power-
of-two scale), searched, together with the bit-split choice, by grid search
against direct reconstruction MSE -- the same "hold everything else fixed,
scan a small set of candidates, keep whichever minimizes a direct error
metric" shape :func:`onnxsim.calibration._mse_threshold`/:func:`onnxsim.
calibration._entropy_threshold` already use for INT8 range calibration
(``_mse_threshold`` scans candidate clip thresholds against *direct*
reconstruction MSE -- the closer analogue to this module's own objective;
``_entropy_threshold`` scans the same kind of candidates against a
histogram-based KL divergence instead. This module scans candidate
*(format, clip ratio)* pairs against MSE -- a different, two-dimensional
search space, same "grid search over candidates" shape).

    Before:
      Y = MatMul(X, W) [+ bias]      -- W constant, [K, N], float32

    After:
      Codebook: initializer, float32 [16]  -- winning format's 16 fixed
                                               values (shared across every
                                               layer that picks this format)
      Wq: initializer, uint8 [K, N]        -- codebook index per element
      Ws: initializer, float32 [K/block_size, N]  -- real-valued (not
                                               power-of-two) scale per block
      What_hat = Reshape(Mul(Reshape(Gather(Codebook, Wq)), Ws), ...)
      Y = MatMul(X, What_hat) [+ bias]

**Deliberately not ported: activation quantization (W4A4) via cross-layer
exponent-bias migration.** The paper's other headline contribution is
"pre-shifted exponent bias" applied to *activations*: transformer
activations carry per-channel outliers (the same phenomenon
:mod:`onnxsim.smoothquant`/:mod:`onnxsim.outlier_suppression` address for
INT8), so the paper computes a per-channel real-valued scale from
calibration data and migrates it algebraically into the preceding weight or
LayerNormalization (exactly :mod:`onnxsim.smoothquant`'s and
:mod:`onnxsim.outlier_suppression`'s own migration, with FP4's real-valued
scale-as-bias standing in for those modules' INT8 quantization range) so
that, after migration, a *single* shared exponent bias suffices for a
straightforward per-tensor FP4 activation quantizer at graph-run time. That
migration machinery already exists in this repo (:func:`onnxsim.
apply_smoothquant`, :func:`onnxsim.apply_outlier_suppression`) and composes
with this module unchanged: run either migration pass first, then quantize
the migrated model's activations with a per-tensor FP4 QDQ-style insertion.
Building that activation-side QDQ insertion itself -- the graph-run-time
"quantize X to FP4, matmul against Wq" pipeline, analogous to
:mod:`onnxsim.zeroquant`'s own runtime activation quantization but emitting
FP4 codes instead of INT8 -- is real, non-trivial additional scope (a new
runtime dequantization/quantization subgraph, not a data-flow migration),
and is not implemented here. This module covers weight-only W4 quantization
with the paper's own format-and-bias search as its differentiator from
:mod:`onnxsim.mx_quantization`/:mod:`onnxsim.nf4`; W4A4 is a legitimate
follow-up, not attempted in this module.

ONNX has no native FP4 tensor type (as of this writing), so -- following the
exact same approach :mod:`onnxsim.mx_quantization`/:mod:`onnxsim.nf4` already
use for their own codebook formats -- this module builds the dequantization
out of ordinary ONNX ops any opset-11+ runtime already supports: ``Gather``
the per-element code out of a 16-entry constant codebook, then ``Mul`` by
the per-block real-valued scale.

**Update: two activation-side passes now exist.** The "deliberately not
ported" section above is no longer wholly accurate: this paragraph
supersedes its closing "is not implemented here"/"W4A4 is a legitimate
follow-up, not attempted in this module" claims (its description of what
the paper's own activation scheme *is* remains accurate, and is what
:func:`apply_llm_fp4_activation_quantization_per_tensor` below implements
the quantizer half of). Both passes act only on layers
:func:`quantize_weight_only_llm_fp4` has already weight-quantized (found by
walking the weight input backward through that function's own exact
dequantization pattern -- see :func:`_find_llm_fp4_weight_codebook`), and
both reuse that layer's own recovered codebook rather than re-deriving one:

* :func:`apply_llm_fp4_activation_quantization` -- **per-token,
  data-free**, and *not* the paper's own design. It computes the scale
  fresh from each token's own values at graph-run time, exactly the
  convention every other per-token runtime quantizer in this repo already
  uses (:mod:`onnxsim.zeroquant`, :mod:`onnxsim.quarot`,
  :mod:`onnxsim.duquant`, :mod:`onnxsim.attention_quantization`,
  :mod:`onnxsim.kv_cache_quantization`'s Value-style rewrite), just against
  FP4's non-uniform 16-value codebook instead of a uniform integer grid.
  No calibration data and no migration pass needed.
* :func:`apply_llm_fp4_activation_quantization_per_tensor` -- the
  **calibrated per-tensor** half of the paper's own design. It fits one
  real-valued scale per activation tensor offline, from calibration data,
  by the *same* ``(clip ratio -> reconstruction MSE)`` grid search the
  weight side already uses (:func:`_search_fp4_clip_ratio`, shared by both),
  and bakes it into the graph as a constant initializer -- so the emitted
  quantize/dequantize subgraph contains no runtime range reduction at all.
  The *other* half of the paper's design -- migrating the per-channel
  outliers into the preceding weight/LayerNormalization, which is what
  makes a single shared exponent bias sufficient in the first place -- is
  still **not** performed by that function; the caller composes it by
  running :func:`onnxsim.apply_smoothquant` or
  :func:`onnxsim.apply_outlier_suppression` first, as the "deliberately not
  ported" section above already anticipated. See that function's own
  docstring for the three-call sequence and the full honesty note.

    is implemented by this module's own
    :func:`apply_llm_fp4_activation_quantization_per_tensor`, which is the

    apply_outlier_suppression` beforehand remains possible (they act on the
    weight/LayerNorm side and are unaffected by this pass, since it never
    touches those), but this simpler design does not require it.

    For each layer already matched by :func:`quantize_weight_only_llm_fp4`
    (found by walking its weight input backward through that function's
    exact dequantization pattern -- see :func:`_find_llm_fp4_weight_codebook`
    -- so a layer this module didn't itself weight-quantize is left
    completely untouched), the activation ``X`` is quantized as::

        x_dequant = nearest * scale

    "Nearest codebook value" is found by broadcasting every element against
    all 16 codebook entries and taking ``ArgMin`` over the distances, then
    gathering the codebook by that index -- the same "distance to every
    codebook entry, then argmin" idea this module's own (offline, numpy)
    weight-side search and :mod:`onnxsim.iq4_nl`'s own codebook search
    already use, just expressed as runtime ONNX ops since ``X`` is not a
    compile-time constant here. This construction was checked directly
    against a numpy reference via ``onnxruntime`` before being committed to
    this module (see ``tests/test_llm_fp4.py``).

    **Runtime cost, beyond node count.** That broadcast is the price of a
    *non-uniform* codebook: unlike a uniform integer grid (which quantizes
    with plain arithmetic, as :mod:`onnxsim.quarot`/:mod:`onnxsim.zeroquant`
    do), finding the nearest of 16 arbitrary values needs each element
    compared against all 16, so the ``Sub``/``Abs`` intermediates are **16x
    the activation's own size** while the lookup executes. On a large
    activation that transient dominates this pass's memory, and no count of

    This is the **calibrated per-tensor** half of the LLM-FP4 paper's own

    real-valued per-tensor scale -- the same degree of freedom, see this

    the same codebook-round-trip MSE objective

    this function is only the second one:

    1. **Per-channel outlier migration** -- compute a per-channel
       real-valued scale from calibration data and push it algebraically
       into the preceding weight or LayerNormalization, so that what
       reaches this layer no longer carries per-channel outliers and a
       single shared scale/exponent bias actually suffices. This function
       does **not** do this, and does not check whether it has been done.
    2. **The per-tensor FP4 quantizer itself** -- this function.

    Piece 1 already exists in this repo, as
    :func:`onnxsim.apply_smoothquant` and
    :func:`onnxsim.apply_outlier_suppression` (their INT8 migration algebra
    is exactly the migration the paper describes, with FP4's real-valued
    scale-as-bias standing in for those modules' INT8 quantization range),
    so the paper's actual pipeline is a **three-call sequence** the caller
    composes, migration first::

        import onnxsim

        #    weight/LayerNormalization (apply_outlier_suppression is the
        #    alternative)
        migrated = onnxsim.apply_smoothquant(model)
        # 2. weight-side FP4, with the paper's own (format, scale) search
        weight_q = onnxsim.quantize_weight_only_llm_fp4(migrated)
        # 3. this function: one calibrated, constant per-tensor FP4 scale
        #    per activation
        w4a4 = onnxsim.apply_llm_fp4_activation_quantization_per_tensor(
            weight_q
        )

    Running this function *without* step 1 is supported and produces a
    valid model, but it is then quantizing an unmigrated activation with a
    single shared scale -- precisely the case the paper's migration exists
    to avoid, and on outlier-heavy transformer activations it will be
    noticeably worse than the paper's own reported numbers.

    **How this differs from
    :func:`apply_llm_fp4_activation_quantization`** (the per-token pass in
    this same module):

    * *Scale source*: calibration data, fit offline -- versus data-free,
      recomputed from the tensor's own values at graph-run time.
    * *Granularity*: one scale for the whole activation tensor -- versus
      one scale per token (per row of the last axis).
    * *Where the scale lives*: a constant initializer -- versus runtime
      ``Abs``/``ReduceMax``/``Max`` nodes.
    * *Runtime cost*: 7 nodes per layer (``Div``, ``Unsqueeze``, ``Sub``,
      ``Abs``, ``ArgMin``, ``Gather``, ``Mul``) -- versus 11 for the
      per-token pass (those same 7, plus ``Abs``, ``ReduceMax``, ``Max``
      and a second ``Div`` to derive the scale). Strictly fewer runtime
      ops is the practical point of the per-tensor design. Note node count
      is not the whole cost: **both** passes share the
      ``Unsqueeze``/``Sub``/``Abs``/``ArgMin`` nearest-codebook broadcast,
      whose intermediates are 16x the activation's own size while it
      executes -- inherent to a non-uniform codebook, and unchanged by
      moving the scale to a constant. See
      :func:`apply_llm_fp4_activation_quantization`'s own "Runtime cost"
      note.
    * *Paper fidelity*: this is the paper's own quantizer (its migration
      half being the caller's job, above) -- the per-token pass is a
      simpler repo-convention alternative
      (:mod:`onnxsim.zeroquant`/:mod:`onnxsim.quarot`/
      :mod:`onnxsim.duquant` all quantize activations per-token) that is
      explicitly *not* the paper's design.

    Neither pass emits a native FP4 tensor (ONNX has no FP4 type): both are
    simulated ("fake") quantization -- values are snapped onto the FP4
    codebook grid and immediately dequantized back to float32, so the
    ``MatMul`` still runs in float. That is the same simulation
    :mod:`onnxsim.mx_quantization`/:mod:`onnxsim.nf4`/
    :mod:`onnxsim.zeroquant` already use, and it measures the accuracy
    effect of FP4 activations without needing runtime FP4 kernels.

    For each layer already matched by :func:`quantize_weight_only_llm_fp4`
    (found by walking its weight input backward through that function's
    exact dequantization pattern -- see
    :func:`_find_llm_fp4_weight_codebook` -- so a layer this module didn't
    itself weight-quantize is left completely untouched), the activation
    ``X`` is quantized as::

        scale   -- constant float32 initializer, fit offline (see below)
        x_normalized = X / scale
        nearest = Gather(Codebook, ArgMin(Abs(Unsqueeze(x_normalized, -1)
                                              - Codebook), axis=-1))
        x_dequant = nearest * scale

    -- the same ``Unsqueeze``/``Sub``/``Abs``/``ArgMin``/``Gather``
    nearest-codebook construction the per-token pass already uses (and
    which was verified against a hand-computed numpy reference through
    ``onnxruntime``; see ``tests/test_llm_fp4.py``), but with a
    compile-time-constant ``scale``, so **no** ``Abs``/``ReduceMax``/
    ``Max`` range-reduction node is emitted at all.

    ``scale`` itself is fit by capturing ``X`` over ``calibration_data``
    (the ``_add_probe_outputs`` + :func:`onnxsim.backend.run_model` capture
    every calibration-driven pass in this repo uses -- see
    :func:`onnxsim.apply_gptq`), concatenating every captured batch into
    one flat sample, and grid-searching ``clip_ratios`` against that
    sample's own codebook round-trip MSE. The FP4 *format* is **not**
    re-searched: it was already fixed for this layer by
    :func:`quantize_weight_only_llm_fp4`'s own per-weight-tensor search,
    and the recovered codebook is exactly what encodes that choice.

    :param model: a weight-quantized onnx ModelProto or file path -- must
            already have been passed through
            :func:`quantize_weight_only_llm_fp4` for this function to do
            anything, since it only recognizes that function's own exact
            weight-dequantization pattern
    :param calibration_data: representative input batches to fit each
            activation's scale on. Each batch is a
            ``{input_name: np.ndarray}`` dict matching ``model``'s graph
            inputs -- see :func:`onnxsim.generate_random_calibration_data`
            (the default when omitted) and
            :func:`onnxsim.load_huggingface_calibration_data` (real data, a
            much more representative activation range than random input)
    :param num_samples: random batches to generate when
            ``calibration_data`` is omitted
    :param seed: seed for the random calibration data (ignored if
            ``calibration_data`` is supplied)
    :param clip_ratios: per-tensor clip-ratio candidates to grid-search --
            ``1.0`` puts the activation's own observed max-abs value
            exactly at the codebook's largest magnitude (no clipping),
            values below ``1.0`` trade a harder clip on outliers for
            sharper resolution on the bulk. Defaults to the weight side's
            own default grid: 17 points evenly spaced over ``[0.5, 1.0]``
            (:func:`quantize_weight_only_llm_fp4`'s own ``min_clip_ratio``/
            ``num_scale_candidates`` defaults)
    :param providers: onnxruntime execution providers to run ``model`` on
            when capturing calibration activations
    :returns: ``model`` with every already-FP4-weight-quantized layer's
            activation input replaced by a static, per-tensor FP4
            quantize/dequantize round-trip driven by a constant scale
            initializer; every other input (weight, bias) and the node's
            own output name are left exactly as
            :func:`quantize_weight_only_llm_fp4` left them. A layer whose
            weight input isn't fed by exactly that function's own
            dequantization pattern, or whose activation no calibration
            batch reached (or for which every captured value was zero or
            non-finite), is left completely untouched -- this function
            never silently falls back to a different scale scheme under its
            own name. A model with no such layer, or with an opset older
            than 13, is returned unchanged. (Opset 13, not the per-token
            pass's 18: the ops emitted here are ``Unsqueeze`` -- whose
            ``axes``-as-input form is what needs 13 -- plus ``ArgMin``/
            ``Gather``/``Sub``/``Abs``/``Div``/``Mul``, all older. The
            per-token pass needs 18 only for ``ReduceMax``'s own
            ``axes``-as-input form, and this pass emits no ``ReduceMax``.)

    Delegates to
    :func:`onnxsim.apply_llm_fp4_activation_quantization_per_tensor_cpp`
    (the verified C++ port), which emits the exact same node pattern this
    function's own docstring describes, including the same 17-point
    ``[0.5, 1.0]`` default clip-ratio grid. This pure-Python name is kept
    only for backward compatibility with existing callers.

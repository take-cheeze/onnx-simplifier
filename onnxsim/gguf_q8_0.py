"""llama.cpp's GGUF "Q8_0" block quant format -- the simplest, and the
highest-precision, of every GGUF quant format this repo covers.

A Q8_0 block is a single flat 32-element block sharing one fp16 scale
``d``, with each element's code a *full signed 8-bit integer*
(``[-128, 127]``, real two's complement): ``dequant = code * d``. There
is no bias (unlike :mod:`onnxsim.gguf_legacy_quant`'s own Q4_0, whose
unsigned 4-bit code carries a fixed ``-8`` offset), no explicit min
(unlike that module's Q4_1), no sub-block requantization, no codebook,
and -- since the code is already a whole byte -- no bit-packing at all.
On disk a block is literally 2 bytes of float16 scale followed by 32 raw
signed bytes. Structurally this is closer to a trivial per-32-element
INT8 round trip than to the bit-packed 4/5-bit legacy family.

onnxsim already *reads* the format -- see ``onnxsim/ggml_kquant.h``'s
``DequantizeQ8_0Block``, the verified decoder this module's own
dequantization math is deliberately kept consistent with. Note that the
decoder lives in the *K-quant* header rather than
``onnxsim/ggml_legacy_quant.h``: onnxsim's own dtype mapping classifies
Q8_0 alongside the K-quant family (see ``onnxsim/gguf_dtype.h``'s own
comment on the types "this mapping covers", and its ``IsKQuant``), even
though Q8_0 is structurally a flat 32-element block rather than a
256-element super-block. Readers looking for it among the legacy
Q4_0/Q4_1/Q5_0/Q5_1 encoders (:mod:`onnxsim.gguf_legacy_quant`,
:mod:`onnxsim.gguf_legacy_quant_5bit`) will find only the format family
it resembles, not Q8_0 itself -- hence this separate module.

The result is represented as an ordinary float32 quantize-dequantize
round trip folded directly into a new initializer -- the same
simplification every sibling GGUF encoder here already makes.

**Honesty note**: the *dequantization* formula this encoder targets
(``code * d``) is transcribed directly from, and matches exactly, this
repository's own verified ``onnxsim/ggml_kquant.h`` (itself transcribed
from GGML's own ``ggml-quants.c`` reference -- see that header's own
top-of-file comment). What is **not** independently verified is
llama.cpp's own *encoder* procedure for choosing ``d``
(``quantize_row_q8_0``'s own exact max handling) -- this module's own
encoder uses the straightforward, honestly-scoped choice:
``d = max(abs(block)) / 127``, so the largest-magnitude element of a
block maps to code ``+127`` or ``-127``. A consequence worth stating:
code ``-128`` is technically unreachable by this encoder, since real
two's-complement int8 has the asymmetric range ``[-128, 127]`` while a
magnitude-based scale only ever reaches the symmetric ``[-127, 127]``
subset. That costs at most one code out of 256 and keeps zero mapping
exactly to zero. Not claimed to be a byte-exact reproduction of
llama.cpp's own encoder, only its documented format's own reconstruction
semantics -- verified in this module's own test file with real numpy
arithmetic, not a recalled/assumed constant.

**Scope**: matches ``MatMul``/"vanilla" ``Gemm`` (via
:func:`onnxsim.llm_int8._match_matmul_like`) and, optionally, ``Conv`` --
any constant float32 weight, of any rank, is flattened, zero-padded up to
a whole number of 32-element blocks, quantized, and reshaped back. No
calibration data is needed.

"""llama.cpp's GGUF "Q2_K" K-quant format -- the *lowest*-precision member
of the K-quant family, the block layout real ``.gguf`` presets (``Q2_K``,
``Q2_K_S``, ...) use for their least output-sensitive tensors, where two
bits per element is all the budget a weight gets. Joins
:mod:`onnxsim.gguf_kquant` (Q4_K) and :mod:`onnxsim.gguf_q6_k` (Q6_K) as
this repo's third member of the K-quant family proper -- distinct from the
plainer :mod:`onnxsim.gguf_legacy_quant` (Q4_0/Q4_1, one flat scale per
block, no super-block) and :mod:`onnxsim.iq4_nl`/
:mod:`onnxsim.gguf_ternary_quant` (a fixed codebook or ternary code, not a
re-quantized affine scale).

onnxsim already *reads* Q2_K when importing a GGUF checkpoint -- see
``onnxsim/ggml_kquant.h``'s ``DequantizeQ2_KBlock``, which this module's
own dequantization math is deliberately kept consistent with (the same
"verified against this repo's own existing decoder" discipline
:mod:`onnxsim.gguf_kquant`'s own docstring already documents). What has
been missing is the encoder direction: nothing in onnxsim could take a
float32 ONNX weight and quantize it *into* that format.

**Q2_K's block structure**: a 256-element super-block is split into **16
sub-blocks of 16** elements (not Q4_K/Q5_K's 8 sub-blocks of 32). Each
sub-block gets its own asymmetric affine quantizer, ``dequant = q *
sub_scale + sub_min``, whose element code ``q`` is only **2 bits**
(``[0, 3]``) -- four reconstruction levels per sub-block, which is why
Q2_K compensates with four times as many sub-blocks as Q4_K. As in Q4_K,
the per-sub-block ``(scale, min)`` pair is itself re-quantized rather
than stored as two float32s: each sub-block's scale and negative-offset
magnitude become **4-bit** codes (``[0, 15]``, packed two-to-a-byte in a
real ``.gguf`` file) relative to one shared pair of super-block-level
float16 reference values (``d``/``dmin``). Per sub-block ``j``:

    value = d * sc_j * q - dmin * m_j,  q in [0, 3],  sc_j, m_j in [0, 15]

-- transcribed directly from, and cross-checked element-for-element
against, ``onnxsim/ggml_kquant.h``'s own ``DequantizeQ2_KBlock`` (whose
``dl = d * (sc & 0xF)`` / ``ml = dmin * (sc >> 4)`` is exactly the
4-bit scale code and 4-bit min code sharing one byte). In the
``q * sub_scale + sub_min`` form above that is ``sub_scale_j = d*sc_j``
and ``sub_min_j = -(dmin*m_j)``.

**Honesty note on exactly how this was verified**: as with
:mod:`onnxsim.gguf_kquant`'s own Q4_K encoder and
:mod:`onnxsim.gguf_q6_k`'s Q6_K one, what is verified here is the
*dequantization* formula above -- it matches this repository's own
already-verified decoder, ``ggml_kquant.h``'s ``DequantizeQ2_KBlock``,
which is itself transcribed from GGML's ``ggml-quants.c`` reference and
is what onnxsim reads real ``.gguf`` files with today. llama.cpp's own
*encoder* (``quantize_row_q2_K``'s exact procedure for choosing each
sub-block's ideal (scale, min) and requantizing them to 4 bits -- e.g.
whether it uses a plain min/max affine fit or a weighted least-squares
search) was **not** available to read alongside that decoder. This
module's encoder therefore uses the same straightforward,
honestly-scoped mechanism :mod:`onnxsim.gguf_kquant`'s Q4_K encoder
already established, adapted to Q2_K's own bit-widths: an ordinary
per-sub-block min/max affine fit, then requantizing each sub-block's
scale/min to a 4-bit code relative to the super-block's own largest
scale/min (so the largest sub-block scale/min maps to the top of the
4-bit range, as a shared-reference-pair scheme requires). It is **not**
claimed to be a byte-exact reproduction of llama.cpp's own encoder --
only of its documented format's own reconstruction semantics, verified
in ``tests/test_gguf_q2_k.py`` with real numpy arithmetic (not
recalled/assumed constants), including that this genuinely coarser
format really does reconstruct measurably worse than Q4_K's own 4-bit
codes on the same weight.

**Scope**: matches ``MatMul``/"vanilla" ``Gemm`` (via
:func:`onnxsim.llm_int8._match_matmul_like`, shared with several other
onnxsim modules) and, optionally, ``Conv`` -- any constant float32
weight, of any rank, is flattened, zero-padded up to a whole number of
256-element super-blocks, quantized, and reshaped back; padding elements
are quantized along with the rest but discarded before reshaping, so they
cannot affect the tensor's real values (only, very slightly, a boundary
sub-block's own chosen scale/min, for tensors whose element count isn't
itself a multiple of 16). No calibration data is needed -- like NF4,
every quantization decision comes from the weight tensor's own values.
As onnxsim has no ONNX tensor type below INT4 -- let alone one for Q2_K's
own packed, fractional (2.625-bit-per-element average) storage -- the
result is represented as an ordinary float32 quantize-dequantize round
trip folded directly into a new initializer, exactly the pattern every
weight-only ``quantize_*``/``apply_*`` function in this repo already uses
(no new graph nodes needed).

// Block-wise QAT, reachable without Python.
//
// onnxsim/qat.py builds a training step graph for one block of a model and
// then drives it: capture the float model's activations, run the step graph in
// a loop, write the trained weights back. The graph-building half is pure
// graph surgery and is what this header ports; the driving half is not here
// and should not be, because the caller already has an inference runtime --
// onnxruntime-web in the browser -- and running a graph in a loop is that
// runtime's job.
//
// That split is what makes the port small enough to be worth trusting.
// qat.py's _build_step_graph reads its captured activations for `value.shape`
// and nothing else: the values become graph *inputs* the caller binds, never
// baked-in constants. So building the step graph needs shapes, not data, and
// the browser can capture the activations itself and hand them straight to the
// loop.
//
// The intended browser flow:
//   1. BuildQatStepGraph(float, quantized, block in/out, rows, opts)
//        -> a step graph, the state ping-pong map, the list of activations to
//           capture, and the initial state tensors
//   2. the caller captures those activations from the float model (ort-web),
//      binds them plus the initial state, and runs the step graph `n` times,
//      feeding the per-step scalars and carrying state outputs back to inputs
//   3. WriteBackQatState(quantized, plan, final state) -> the tuned model
//
// **Parity with the Python is a hard requirement, not an aspiration.** Two
// implementations that disagree would train a model differently in the browser
// than in Python and nothing would say so. onnxsim/qat_parity_fixtures.txt and
// its two tests already enforce that for the emitter primitives; a planner
// case is added there for the same reason. Emit the same nodes in the same
// order as qat.py, because GraphBuilder's name counter makes tensor names out
// of that order and the fixture compares names.

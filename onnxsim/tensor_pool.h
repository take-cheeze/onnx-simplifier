 * TensorPool: a ref-counted, name-keyed store of tensor byte buffers, with a
 * HuggingFace safetensors (https://github.com/huggingface/safetensors) file
 * as its serialization format.
 *
 * Motivation (reducing onnx::TensorProto data copies): onnx::TensorProto
 * physically owns its `raw_data` bytes as a plain std::string, so ordinary
 * protobuf copies (ModelProto assignment, onnx-optimizer's Import/Export
 * round trip, a Python trampoline hop) each deep-copy every initializer's
 * payload -- see onnxsim.cpp's OptimizeFixed move-through-the-round-trip fix
 * for issue #633, which works around exactly this for one specific call
 * site. TensorPool generalizes the same idea for the two places a real copy
 * is otherwise unavoidable:
 *
 *   1. Loading weights from disk: onnx's own external-data loader (and a
 *      naive safetensors reader) memcpy's each tensor's slice out of the
 *      file into a fresh TensorProto.raw_data. LoadSafetensors instead reads
 *      the file into ONE owned buffer and hands out std::shared_ptr-aliased
 *      views into it -- one copy total (the disk read), not one per tensor,
 *      and every Entry a caller Finds() shares that same buffer for free.
 *   2. Saving weights back out: SaveSafetensors writes each entry straight
 *      from its own buffer -- it never concatenates the pool into one
 *      in-memory blob first.
 *
 * TensorPool itself is dependency-free of onnx/protobuf (only the *integer*
 * ONNX dtype codes from tensor_pool_dtype.h, plus the vendored BLAKE3 and
 * self-contained SHA-256 backing ContentHash/SetHashAlgorithm below -- see
 * tensor_pool_hash.h), so it builds and unit-tests standalone -- mirrors
 * the dlpack_dtype.h / dlpack_bridge.h split. The
 * onnx::TensorProto <-> TensorPool glue lives in tensor_pool_bridge.h; see
 * that header's comment for how (and where) it's safe to plug a pool into
 * onnxsim's existing passes -- notably, several of them (onnxsim.cpp's
 * IsAllZeroTensor and integer-tensor extraction, dlpack_bridge.h's
 * FromTensorProtoBorrowing) already special-case and skip
 * onnx::TensorProto::EXTERNAL tensors, so a pool reference is only safe to
 * hand them once it has been hydrated back to an ordinary in-memory tensor.
 *
 * File format (https://github.com/huggingface/safetensors#format):
 *   [8 bytes] header length N, u64 little-endian
 *   [N bytes] UTF-8 JSON header: a flat object of
 *     {"<name>": {"dtype": "<code>", "shape": [...],
 *                 "data_offsets": [begin, end]}, ...},
 *     plus an optional "__metadata__" entry (arbitrary string->string map,
 *     skipped by this reader)
 *   [rest of file] raw tensor bytes, concatenated at the offsets the header
 *     describes, relative to the end of the header
 * This is onnx's own "raw external data in a file" layout with a JSON
 * manifest bolted on: a tensor is addressed the same way (an offset + length
 * range in a file), just keyed by name via the header instead of by
 * per-tensor location/offset/length entries living in the TensorProto
 * itself. That means a TensorPool's file is BOTH a standard safetensors file
 * (openable by the `safetensors` Python package, HF `transformers`/
 * `diffusers`, etc., with no onnxsim involved) AND usable, unmodified, as the
 * backing file for onnx's own classic external-data mechanism, by pointing
 * each TensorProto's external_data offset past the header (see
 * tensor_pool_bridge.h's ExportModelWithSafetensors).
 *
 * Byte order: like onnx::TensorProto::raw_data (which ONNX's spec fixes to
 * little-endian on every host) and every safetensors file actually produced
 * in the wild, an Entry's `data` is *always* little-endian bytes, regardless
 * of host byte order. TensorPool never interprets or swaps them -- only the
 * file's own 8-byte header-length prefix, which this pool reads/writes byte
 * by byte, needs (and gets) explicit little-endian handling for correctness
 * on a big-endian host (this repo tests on s390x; see dlpack_dtype.h's
 * kRawDataIsHostOrder for the *other* boundary, where such bytes are
 * eventually swapped into host order for arithmetic).

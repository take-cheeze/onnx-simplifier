"""A ``torch.compile``-styled training loop, built entirely out of onnxsim's
own grad templating.

``torch.compile`` wraps an eager Python callable: the first call traces and
compiles it, and every later call with compatible inputs reuses that
compiled artifact instead of re-tracing. :func:`compile_training_loop` gives
an ONNX model's training step the same shape -- lazy compilation on first
call, a cached artifact on every call after that -- but what gets compiled is
not a Python trace. It is a single ONNX step graph, assembled the way
:mod:`onnxsim.qat` already assembles one for block-wise QAT:

- :func:`onnxsim.graph_grad.build_backward` differentiates the forward graph
  once, in reverse, emitting the gradient as ordinary ONNX nodes.
- :mod:`onnxsim.qat_graph` wires an :func:`~onnxsim.qat_graph.adam_update`
  (or :func:`~onnxsim.qat_graph.sgd_momentum_update`) onto each trained
  parameter and assembles forward, backward and optimizer into one
  :class:`~onnxsim.qat_graph.StepGraph`.
- :class:`onnxsim.backend.Runner` creates the onnxruntime session for that
  graph once; every subsequent call reuses it.

There is no torch dependency anywhere in this module, and no autograd tape:
differentiation happens once, at compile time, exactly as
:mod:`onnxsim.graph_grad`'s own module docstring describes. What this adds on
top of :mod:`onnxsim.qat_graph`'s ``run_step_graph`` -- which already runs a
:class:`~onnxsim.qat_graph.StepGraph` for a fixed number of steps with a
fixed set of constants -- is the calling convention: a plain callable that
compiles itself lazily on first use and takes a fresh batch of feeds on every
call, the shape an ordinary training loop actually has.

**Copying.** When onnxruntime is installed, :meth:`TrainingLoop.__call__`
never round-trips the trained parameters or the optimizer's own moments
through numpy between steps: they are kept as ``onnxruntime.OrtValue``
(:func:`onnxsim.backend.as_ort_value`/:meth:`onnxsim.backend.Runner.run_with_ort_values`)
and threaded straight from one step's output back in as the next step's
input. ``feeds`` -- the batch itself -- takes the same path: anything that
implements the DLPack protocol (a torch tensor, CPU, CUDA or ROCm/HIP; a numpy array
new enough to implement it) is bound by reference rather than copied into a
fresh buffer first. A plain ``numpy.ndarray`` too old for ``__dlpack__``
still only pays the one copy ``OrtValue.ortvalue_from_numpy`` needs (and on
the CPU, not even that -- it aliases). Falls back to the plain numpy path
automatically when onnxruntime is not installed (the reference-evaluator
backend has no ``OrtValue``/DLPack concept at all); the numbers this returns
are identical either way, only the copying differs.

**GPU execution (CUDA / ROCm / MIGraphX).** Genuinely zero-copy end to end:
pass ``providers=["CUDAExecutionProvider", "CPUExecutionProvider"]`` on NVIDIA
(or ``["ROCMExecutionProvider", "CPUExecutionProvider"]`` /
``["MIGraphXExecutionProvider", "CPUExecutionProvider"]`` on AMD ROCm -- see
``scripts/amd/README.md`` for the wheel to install,
``onnxruntime-rocm``/``onnxruntime-migraphx``) to
:func:`compile_training_loop`/``onnxsim.compile_torch_training_loop`` and
feed device-resident tensors (a ``torch.Tensor`` already on ``"cuda"`` -- which
is also what a ROCm/HIP torch build reports its device as -- or any other
object whose ``__dlpack_device__`` reports the matching device) --
``as_ort_value`` is device-agnostic, so this needs no GPU-vendor-specific code
of its own, only a matching ``onnxruntime`` build and a session actually
configured to run on it. There is exactly one unavoidable host round trip: the
very first call uploads the forward model's own initializers
(``TrainingLoop``'s initial state), which start out as ordinary host bytes
inside the ONNX model -- there is no tensor on the caller's side yet to alias
for those. From the first call's own outputs on, the trained parameters and
optimizer moments are genuinely device-resident ``OrtValue``\\ s
(onnxruntime's GPU kernels produce them there, and nothing here ever calls
``.numpy()`` on them), so every call after the first pays no host transfer
for the state at all -- only ``feeds`` and the tiny per-step scalars (``lr``,
Adam's bias corrections) cross the bus, and a device-resident ``feeds``
tensor skips even that. See ``tests/test_compile_training.py``'s and
``tests/test_torch_training.py``'s own CUDA-gated tests (skipped without a
matching ``onnxruntime`` build and GPU) for this asserted directly against
``OrtValue.device_name()``, plus the ROCm/MIGraphX-gated training tests beside
them, which assert the same loop converges through those providers.

**MPS / WebGPU.** No zero-copy path exists between a PyTorch MPS tensor
(Apple's Metal backend) and onnxruntime's WebGPU execution provider today,
and that is not something this module can paper over. Two independent
blockers: (1) DLPack device mismatch -- an MPS tensor's own
``__dlpack_device__`` reports ``kDLMetal``, not ``kDLWebGPU``, so
``OrtValue.from_dlpack`` would reject it outright even if onnxruntime's
WebGPU EP accepted external buffers at all; (2) onnxruntime's WebGPU EP
does not expose a public API to import an externally created GPU buffer the
way the CUDA EP does via DLPack/``IOBinding`` -- its buffer manager is
internal. This repository's own WebGPU testing
(``scripts/convertmodel/test/webgpu_*_demo.test.mjs``) additionally runs
onnxruntime-web inside a headless Chromium browser via Playwright -- a
separate process from Python entirely -- so even a hypothetical MPS/WebGPU
DLPack bridge would still have to cross a process boundary, which is a copy
by construction. The practical option today is the same as for any other
unsupported source device: let ``feeds``/parameters cross to host memory
(``.cpu()``/``.numpy()``) before they reach this module.

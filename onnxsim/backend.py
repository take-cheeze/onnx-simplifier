        :func:`as_ort_value` (aliasing the source via DLPack where the source

        ``.numpy()`` -- see ``onnxruntime.OrtValue.numpy()`` -- ever called
        on it.

        This is a different mechanism from :meth:`bind_loop`, not a
        replacement for it: ``bind_loop`` pre-allocates fixed device buffers

        back, for tensors that never needed to leave the device. Over a few
        hundred steps that transfer, not the arithmetic, is the loop.

        ``IOBinding`` is onnxruntime's answer: bind a tensor once, run against

        cannot be set up: no onnxruntime (the reference evaluator has no
        binding and no devices), an onnxruntime too old for ``io_binding``, an
        output whose buffer cannot be pre-allocated (dynamic shape, or a type
        numpy cannot hold), a shape that contradicts the model, or an

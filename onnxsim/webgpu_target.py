"""Flags ``com.microsoft::Attention`` nodes that crash onnxruntime-web's
WebGPU execution provider instead of running on the GPU.

onnxruntime-web's WebGPU backend lists ``Attention`` as a supported op, but
its own operator table (``js/web/docs/webgpu-operators.md``) annotates it
with "need implementing mask and past/present": the WebGPU kernel does not
yet handle the ``mask_index`` or ``past``/``present`` KV-cache inputs. A node
using either one is still a *valid* graph -- ``onnx.checker`` has nothing to
say about it.

**This is not a graceful fallback.** It was originally documented here as
one (matching how ORT's docs describe most operator-coverage gaps: the
unsupported node quietly falls back to another execution provider), but
running the actual check against onnxruntime-web 1.29 found otherwise: ONNX
Runtime's partitioner assigns a node to WebGPU by op type alone --
``GetCapability`` has no way to inspect *which optional inputs are wired
up* -- so a ``mask_index``-bearing ``Attention`` node is still committed to
WebGPU at partition time, and only fails once its kernel actually runs::

    Error: [WebGPU] Kernel "[Attention] " failed. Error: Mask not supported

This happens even with ``wasm`` listed as a fallback provider (verified in
``scripts/convertmodel/test/webgpu_attention_placement.test.mjs``, which
runs this exact scenario in a real browser): a fallback provider only
catches nodes ``GetCapability`` declined outright, not ones that were
accepted and then failed at ``Compute()``-time. So the real, measured
consequence of this gap is ``session.run()`` throwing and the **whole
session failing** -- not "just this node loses acceleration". This was only
confirmed for ``mask_index`` (building a ``past``/``present`` KV-cache tensor
for the same test needs more setup); ``past`` is grouped with the same "need
implementing" note upstream, but is not separately, empirically re-verified
here.

:func:`onnxsim.fuse_attention <onnxsim.onnx_simplifier>`'s own fusion
(``onnxsim/passes/fuse_attention.h``) never produces this shape itself -- it
only matches self-attention with no mask and no past/present to begin with --
so this only ever fires on an ``Attention`` node that was already in the
input model (e.g. exported by another tool) before reaching onnxsim, and
survives simplification unchanged. ``MultiHeadAttention`` is not covered:
onnxsim has no pass that produces or consumes that op, so there is nothing in
this codebase to inspect it for.

Meant to be called on the *output* of
``onnxsim.simplify(model, gemm_fusion_backend="webgpu")`` -- the point where
the model is about to be shipped to a WebGPU-targeting caller -- not on the
input model, since simplification could in principle still add or remove
such a node.

:func:`estimate_webgpu_islands` estimates how many separate contiguous
"WebGPU islands" a flagged node would split the rest of the graph into, and
how many device-copy boundaries would result, *if* the node gracefully fell
back the way ``onnxsim._ep_fragmentation`` assumes -- worth having for
whatever future gap actually does fall back gracefully, but given the
finding above, that model **understates** what actually happens for this
specific, currently-checked gap: a crash, not a fallback with copy overhead.

## Two more gaps, from onnxruntime-web's own operator table

``js/web/docs/webgpu-operators.md`` documents several more rows with a
correctness (not just performance) caveat. Two are checked here, each
statically decidable from the node alone (no shape inference needed) the
same way the Attention check is:

- **``Conv``/``ConvTranspose`` with spatial rank 3.** The table's note reads
  "conv3d is not supported" / "ConvTranspose3d is not supported". Spatial
  rank comes from the ``kernel_shape`` attribute when present, else the ``W``
  initializer's shape. *Unlike* the Attention gap, a 3-D kernel shape **is**
  visible to ``GetCapability`` from static graph info alone, so this one more
  plausibly falls back gracefully instead of crashing -- but that has not
  been independently re-verified in a real browser the way the Attention
  finding was, so :func:`check_webgpu_support` says so rather than asserting
  it.
- **``Resize`` with ``coordinate_transformation_mode="align_corners"`` and a
  constant ``scales`` input that downsamples.** The table's note reads
  "CoordinateTransformMode align_corners is not supported with
  downsampling" -- upsampling is implied to be fine, so this only fires when
  downsampling can actually be confirmed from a constant ``scales``
  initializer; a non-constant ``scales``, or a ``sizes``-based call (which
  would need static shape inference to compare against the input's shape),
  is left unflagged rather than guessed at. Like the Attention gap, the scale
  *values* are a runtime tensor input rather than static graph shape, so
  ``GetCapability`` plausibly can't see this either -- again, not
  independently re-verified, so worded as a plausible mechanism, not a
  confirmed one.

:func:`check_webgpu_support` runs all three checks (Attention, conv/deconv
3-D, Resize) and :func:`estimate_webgpu_islands` folds all three into one
fragmentation estimate -- still a lower bound, per
``onnxsim._ep_fragmentation``'s own caveat, since neither the perf-only rows
(``AveragePool``/``Conv``/``ConvTranspose``/``MaxPool``/``Transpose``'s "need
perf optimization" notes) nor the two blanket "no GPU kernel" rows
(``Reshape``/``Shape``, which would fire on nearly every node in nearly every
graph and add noise without a node-specific condition to check) are checked
here.

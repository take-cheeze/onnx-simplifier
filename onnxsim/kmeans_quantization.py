"""K-means weight-codebook quantization (Han et al., 2015, "Deep
Compression: Compressing Deep Neural Networks with Pruning, Trained
Quantization and Huffman Coding", https://arxiv.org/abs/1510.00149,
Section 3's own "trained quantization" -- the weight-sharing half of that
paper; the pruning half is already covered by
:mod:`onnxsim.pruning`/:mod:`onnxsim.apply_magnitude_pruning`). onnxsim
ports the *idea* (cluster a layer's own weight values, share one codebook
entry across every weight assigned to a cluster) via an ordinary,
from-scratch Lloyd's-algorithm k-means fit -- not the paper's own
gradient-based fine-tuning of the codebook after clustering (a training
loop with no ONNX export path, the same reason :mod:`onnxsim.gptq`/
:mod:`onnxsim.awq` port their own papers' *algorithms* rather than any
framework's live-training code).

Every codebook-based scheme already in onnxsim (:mod:`onnxsim.nf4`,
:mod:`onnxsim.mx_quantization`) uses a **fixed** codebook -- 16 values
chosen once, by the format's own definition (a standard normal
distribution's quantile points for NF4; a 4-bit float format's own bit
patterns for MXFP4), identical for every tensor. This module's codebook
is the opposite: it is fit *per layer*, directly to that layer's own
weight distribution, via k-means (Lloyd's algorithm: alternate assigning
each weight to its nearest centroid, then recomputing each centroid as
the mean of the weights assigned to it, until convergence or a fixed
iteration budget) -- the classical, closed-form-per-iteration, verifiable
procedure for fitting a codebook to actual data, as opposed to NF4/MXFP4's
"the codebook needs no fitting because it isn't data-derived at all" or
:mod:`onnxsim.spinquant`'s eigenbasis (a *rotation*, not a scalar
codebook).

Because the codebook is fit directly to real weight values (not to a
*normalized* [-1, 1] range the way NF4's is), no per-block scale is
needed at all -- the graph is simply:

    Before:
      Y = MatMul(X, W) [+ bias]                 -- W constant, [K, N], float32

    After:
      Codebook: initializer, float32, [2**bits]  -- this LAYER's own fitted centroids
      Codes: initializer, uint8, [K, N]           -- codebook index per element
      Whatever_hat = Gather(Codebook, Cast(Codes, INT64), axis=0)
      Y = MatMul(X, Whatever_hat) [+ bias]

-- two ordinary ops, no ``Reshape``/``Mul`` needed (unlike
:mod:`onnxsim.nf4`, which reshapes to broadcast a *separate* per-block
scale against its codebook lookup): here the gathered codebook value
already *is* the reconstructed weight, since clustering was already done
directly in the weight's own units.

"""Any-Precision LLM (Park, Hyun, Cho, Sung, Choi, 2024, ICML 2024,
"Any-Precision LLM: Low-Cost Deployment of Multiple, Different-Sized
LLMs", https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10517). onnxsim ports the algorithm, not
any framework's code, per the same rationale as :mod:`onnxsim.awq`/
:mod:`onnxsim.gptq` (the paper's own reference implementation quantizes
live PyTorch weights with a custom CUDA kernel serving the packed
multi-precision format, with no ONNX export path).

Every other weight-only quantizer in onnxsim picks **one bit-width** and
quantizes independently for it: asking for both a 4-bit and a 6-bit
version of the same model means running the quantizer twice, from
scratch, with no relationship between the two results beyond sharing the
same float source. Any-Precision LLM's own idea: quantize **once**, to the
*highest* bit-width ever needed, using a scheme where every lower
bit-width's own quantization is recoverable *exactly* by discarding the
highest-order... no, by discarding the *lowest*-order refinement bits of
that single quantization -- a **nested / incremental bit-plane**
construction, not independent per-bit-width quantization. Concretely, for
one value in one channel: start from a 1-bit code (which half of the
value's own local range it falls in), then repeatedly **bisect** -- at each
step, split every *existing* bin into two halves using that bin's own
member values only, appending one more bit to every code -- until reaching
the target maximum bit-width. Because a bin is only ever refined, never
merged or reassigned across an old bin boundary, the code built this way
has an exact algebraic nesting property: the ``b``-bit code, for *any*
``b`` up to the maximum, is recoverable from the max-bit-width code by a
plain integer right-shift (``code_at_max_bits >> (max_bits - b)``) -- one
quantization pass serves every precision level up to its own maximum, the
paper's own "any precision" deployment story (a single stored artifact,
truncate bit-planes for a cheaper/smaller version, keep them all for the
most accurate one).

This module's own version of the per-bin split rule (a good-faith
reproduction of the paper's own described "incremental upgrade" mechanism,
not a transcription of its own exact seed/split procedure, which this
module does not claim to reproduce exactly): each bisection step splits a
bin at the **midpoint of that bin's own current member values**
(``0.5 * (bin.min() + bin.max())``) -- simple, deterministic, and
sufficient to demonstrate the nesting property exactly (verified directly
in this module's own test file: the algebraic right-shift relationship
holds bit-for-bit, not just approximately). After the code tree is built
once (to ``max_bits``), materializing any single precision level ``bits``
is: right-shift the max-depth code down to a ``bits``-wide code, then
reconstruct each element as **the mean of its own bin's own original
values** -- the maximum-likelihood constant reconstruction for a fixed
partition. This module's first implementation instead fit one global
affine map (``value ~= code * scale + zero``) per block, by analogy with
every *uniform* quantizer elsewhere in this repo -- but this scheme's own
bins are not laid out on any fixed linear grid (each bisection's own split
point comes from that specific bin's own local data), so a straight-line
fit across all codes is not guaranteed to improve as bins get refined, and
empirically did not (caught by this module's own
reconstruction-improves-with-more-bits test, which failed under the
affine version and passes under the per-bin-mean version below). Per-bin
mean reconstruction, by contrast, *is* guaranteed monotonically
non-increasing in squared error as bins are refined further -- splitting a
bin can only reduce or preserve the variance it contributes (the law of
total variance), never increase it.

**What this module does not claim.** The paper's own reported gains are
about *deployment infrastructure* (one download serves many precisions,
with a real packed-bit-plane storage format and a custom serving kernel);
this module verifies the *nesting property* holds exactly, and that
reconstruction error at any single materialized precision is *competitive
with* (not necessarily better than) an ordinary independent quantizer at
that same precision -- being constrained to reuse a lower level's own bin
boundaries is a real constraint an independent quantizer doesn't have, so
this module does not claim nested quantization always wins on raw
accuracy at a fixed bit-width, only that it wins on not needing to
re-quantize from scratch for every precision level. As with several other
modules in this repo (:mod:`onnxsim.ibert_gelu`, :mod:`onnxsim.ibert_softmax`),
onnxsim has no lower-than-float32, arbitrary-bit-width ONNX tensor type to
express genuine packed sub-8-bit storage in (only INT4 and INT8 are
native) -- this module represents every materialized precision level as an
ordinary float32 quantize-dequantize round trip (the same simplification
:mod:`onnxsim.easyquant` already makes for its own W8A8 weights), not a
literal packed multi-bit-plane binary format.

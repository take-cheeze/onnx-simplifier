"""Label-free, block-wise quantization-aware fine-tuning -- ``docs/qat.md``'s
deliverable B, the "knowledge-distillation QAT" that stage 2 of that note
describes.

The same machinery also runs with no quantizer in it at all
(``fake_quant=False``): :func:`apply_block_finetune` and
:func:`apply_block_finetune_all_blocks` train a model's *own float* weights
against a reference model's activations -- ordinary block-wise, label-free
fine-tuning for a model something else already changed. Everything below
applies to it unchanged except the fake-quantizer, which is the only
quantization-specific part of any of it.

Read :mod:`onnxsim.brecq` first. It already optimizes a *block's own final
output* reconstruction error rather than each layer's own, which is the
objective this module keeps unchanged. Two things it does not do, and this
module does:

1. **Any topology :mod:`onnxsim.graph_grad` can differentiate.** BRECQ's own
   block discovery recognizes a strict linear chain of MatMul/Gemm layers
   (plus an optional trailing residual ``Add``), and its own docstring says
   why: every op shape between two quantized layers would mean another
   hand-derived backward pass. :mod:`onnxsim.graph_grad` removed that cost --
   it differentiates a slice of an ONNX graph by walking it in reverse and
   emitting ordinary ONNX nodes -- so a normalization, an activation, a
   GELU's ``Erf``, a residual, or a Softmax between two Linears is now just
   more nodes in the slice. That is the headline change here.
2. **The float weights themselves move.** Every reconstruction pass in this
   repository -- AdaRound, BRECQ, FOEM, FlexRound, AutoRound -- optimizes
   only *which of the two neighbouring integers* a weight rounds to. That
   restriction is what makes them rounding passes. Here the fp32 weight is
   the trained parameter, fake-quantized in the forward against the same
   block-wise INT4 grid, with a straight-through estimator through the
   ``round``/``clip``: an element can migrate several codes away from its
   round-to-nearest starting point if the block's output error says it
   should. That is what makes this QAT rather than a seventh rounding pass.

Optionally (``learn_scales=True``) each weight's per-block quantization
*scale* is trained alongside, LSQ-style (Esser et al., 2020, "Learned Step
Size Quantization"). The gradient is the one :mod:`onnxsim.autoround`
already derives in numpy -- ``d(w_hat)/d(scale)`` is ``code - w/scale`` where
the element is inside the clipping range and just ``code`` where it
saturates -- summed over each scale's own block.

**Everything runs as one ONNX step graph.** The fake-quant forward, the
backward emitted by :func:`onnxsim.graph_grad.build_backward`, and one
:func:`onnxsim.qat_graph.adam_update` per trained tensor are a single pure
``(constants, state, scalars) -> (next state, loss)`` function, driven by
:func:`onnxsim.qat_graph.run_step_graph`. So the loop reaches whatever
execution provider ``step_providers=`` names -- CUDA/ROCm (including MIGraphX),
an NPU EP, WebGPU in the WASM build.

Everything this module *emits* stays inside
:data:`onnxsim.qat_graph.EP_FRIENDLY_OPS` to make that reach real rather
than nominal (no ``Round``:
:meth:`onnxsim.qat_graph.GraphBuilder.round_to_nearest` composes one out of
``Sign``/``Abs``/``Cast``, and this reuses it). Note the boundary, because it
is easy to over-read: the block's *own forward nodes are copied into the step
graph verbatim*, so a block containing a ``Relu``, a ``Softmax`` or a
``LayerNormalization`` produces a step graph containing those too. The
allowlist constrains the fake-quant, the backward and the optimizer -- the
parts this repository writes -- and says nothing about the block. Whether a
given block's step graph runs on a given accelerator therefore depends on
that backend's coverage of the block's own operators as well.

**What this deliberately is not, and does not claim.**

- *Not task-loss QAT.* There are no labels, no dataset API, no metric and no
  training lifecycle -- ``docs/qat.md``'s deliverable C, unchanged and still
  out of scope. The teacher's own activations are the only target, so the
  ceiling is "reproduce the float block", not "recover task accuracy the
  float block never had". Label-free distillation QAT is not paper-QAT
  accuracy and should not be advertised as it.
- *Block-wise by default; end-to-end is reachable and measured worse.*
  :func:`apply_qat` trains one caller-named block per call, exactly
  :mod:`onnxsim.brecq`'s contract (``block_input_name`` /
  ``block_output_name``), and :func:`apply_qat_all_blocks` walks a whole
  model one block at a time -- discovering the blocks with
  :func:`discover_qat_blocks` and, by default, feeding each one the
  student's own activation so it corrects what its predecessors left
  behind.

  ``docs/qat.md`` lists "an optional end-to-end pass on the whole graph" as
  this stage's last open item, on the reading that a block is necessarily
  smaller than the model. It is not: **the whole graph is a legal block.**
  Naming the graph's own input and its own output -- ``apply_qat(float,
  quantized, "X", "Yout")``, or :func:`discover_qat_blocks` with
  ``max_layers_per_block`` above the model's layer count -- builds one step
  graph over every node, trains every quantized layer's master weight
  jointly inside it, and takes the loss against the float model's own final
  output. That is the end-to-end objective exactly, and it is the one slice
  with no teacher-forcing approximation left in it at all: a whole-graph
  slice's only external tensors are the graph's own inputs, whose values are
  identical in teacher and student by construction.

  So there was nothing here to build, and the only question was whether to
  recommend it. Measured against :func:`apply_qat_all_blocks` at an equal
  optimizer-step budget, on residual MLP stacks every one of whose ops has a
  gradient rule (``tests/test_qat.py``), it lands the same way every time:
  end-to-end reaches a **lower** error on the calibration set -- 12-26%
  lower on an eight-stage stack, unsurprisingly, since that is literally the
  quantity it minimizes and the block-wise walk only approximates it -- and
  a **higher** error on held-out inputs, 1-12% higher on the same model, on
  all eight seeds tried. It is buying calibration-set fit that does not
  transfer, which is :mod:`onnxsim.brecq`'s own argument for why the block
  is the right unit: requiring every intermediate activation to match the
  teacher is a far stronger constraint than requiring only the final output
  to, and at calibration scale that constraint is worth more than the
  freedom. Sixty-four times the data narrows the held-out gap from ~15% to
  ~9% without closing it, and by that budget end-to-end has stopped winning
  even on its own objective -- one global loss over sixteen coupled
  parameter groups is a harder problem than sixteen conditioned ones.

  It is also the expensive direction, in the way that decides whether a run
  fits at all. One end-to-end step touches every layer rather than one
  block's, so at an equal step count it costs roughly the block count more
  time (6x on an eight-block model, measured), and its working set is the
  whole model's rather than one block's: three fp32 copies of every trained
  weight (the master weight and Adam's two moments) plus every forward *and*
  backward intermediate at the calibration batch size, all resident
  simultaneously. Measured peak RSS on
  a one-million-parameter stack: 105 MB against the walk's 31 MB -- and the
  walk's is flat in depth where this one is linear in it.

  And it is all-or-nothing on operator coverage where the walk is not: one
  node without a gradient rule refuses the entire model, whereas
  :func:`apply_qat_all_blocks` turns that node into a gap and trains
  everything either side of it. :data:`onnxsim.graph_grad.SUPPORTED_OPS`
  covers 22 of the 202 operators in ONNX's default domain, so on a real
  model that is the binding constraint long before the accuracy question
  above is reached.

  Reach for it on a shallow model, where the two land within a few percent
  of each other in both directions. Do not reach for it on a deep one: it
  will report a better loss while shipping a worse model, which is why the
  loss ``losses=`` records has never been the number ``tests/test_qat.py``
  asserts on.
- *Weight-only by default; activation quantization is opt-in and changes
  the target scheme.* With ``learn_activation_scales=False`` (the default)
  this targets :func:`onnxsim.quantize_weight_only_int4`'s weight-only
  scheme, the same one AdaRound/BRECQ/FOEM target, and there is no
  activation quantizer anywhere in that model to train. With
  ``learn_activation_scales=True`` it targets
  :func:`onnxsim.quantize_static`'s QDQ scheme instead -- uint8 affine
  activations, per-output-channel symmetric INT8 weights -- and trains the
  weights *and* the activation quantizers of that scheme jointly. See
  :func:`apply_qat`'s own docstring for why one flag necessarily selects a
  scheme rather than adding a feature to the other one, and for what is
  refused. The activation gradients are :mod:`onnxsim.adaquant`'s, not a
  second derivation of them.
- *Calibration-scale, even minibatched.* ``batch_size=None`` (the default)
  is full-batch gradient descent: the whole calibration set is one static
  tensor baked into the step graph's shapes, as in every other
  reconstruction pass here. Passing a ``batch_size`` makes each step train
  on that many rows instead -- the set is still uploaded once and stays
  resident, and the step ``Gather``s its own rows out of it, so a step's
  cost stops scaling with the size of the set and a pass over the data
  performs many updates instead of one. What that does *not* do is lift the
  ceiling on how much data a run may use: the set remains one static tensor
  that has to fit in the execution provider's memory (:mod:`onnxsim.qat_graph`
  documents the alternative, which trades the residency away for an
  unbounded stream, and why it was not taken). This is still a
  calibration-scale budget, not a training-scale one, and there is still no
  task loss, no labels and no metric.
- *Measured, not assumed, and not a uniform win.* ``tests/test_qat.py``
  measures both claims rather than asserting them, and one of the two has a
  boundary worth stating here. On a two-Linear-plus-``Relu`` block the
  reconstruction error falls from 16.0 (round-to-nearest) to 6.5, and a
  GELU block's loss falls ~12x -- topologies no existing pass here can
  reconstruct at all. Against :func:`onnxsim.apply_adaround` on a *single*
  layer, where the objective is identical and only the parametrization
  differs, freeing the weight wins when the calibration activations are
  low-rank (rank 1: RTN 5.96, AdaRound 3.07, this 1.78) and **loses** when
  they are full-rank (rank 16: RTN 28.5, AdaRound 14.6, this 22.8). The
  reason is not subtle: a well-determined reconstruction problem has its
  optimum within one quantization step of round-to-nearest, so floor/ceil is
  all the freedom worth having and AdaRound's continuous rectified-sigmoid
  relaxation optimizes that restricted problem better than a hard
  straight-through estimator on a piecewise-constant loss does. Real
  calibration activations are strongly low-rank, which is why this is worth
  having -- but "QAT beats AdaRound" is not a claim this module makes.

  The same standard applied to ``learn_activation_scales``, and it lands in
  the same shape: on a block whose activation range was calibrated from one
  unrepresentative outlier -- ~30x too wide, so activation quantization is
  the binding constraint -- training the quantizers alongside the weights
  takes the whole-model output error from 4.08 (weights alone) to 2.54, 38%
  better, on all three seeds tried. On the *same* block calibrated on
  representative data it does not help at all: 1.23 weights alone against
  1.23 joint at the default learning rate and 1.27 at 1e-1 -- a regression
  at both rates and on all three seeds. Min/max on
  representative data is already close to MSE-optimal, so there is little
  left for a learned clip range to find, and a second coupled parameter
  group makes a solved problem harder. This is a fix for a quantizer whose
  range is wrong, not a free improvement on one whose range is right.

**What the block contract accepts and refuses.** Refusing is loud
wherever the caller named the block: :func:`apply_qat` on a block it cannot
train raises :class:`ValueError`, never returning a silently unchanged
model. :func:`apply_qat_all_blocks` inverts that -- nobody named those
blocks, so an untrainable one is skipped with its reason recorded in the
returned :class:`QATBlockResult` and the walk continues. The slice is the
intersection of the two directions -- nodes downstream of
``block_input_name`` *and* upstream of ``block_output_name`` -- so naming a
boundary cannot drag in a subgraph on the far side of it. A tensor the slice
reads that is neither produced inside it nor an initializer is captured from
the float model as another teacher-forced constant (so a residual arriving
from further upstream, or a second graph input, is fine). It is refused if
``block_output_name`` is not produced by a node, if any node in the slice
has an op type :data:`onnxsim.graph_grad.SUPPORTED_OPS` does not cover
(including one no gradient reaches -- the same standard
:func:`onnxsim.graph_grad.build_backward` holds itself to), if the slice
contains no layer of the *targeted scheme* to train (which scheme that is
depends on ``learn_activation_scales``, so the same block can be trainable
under one and refused under the other -- see :func:`apply_qat`), or if the
block's shapes cannot be inferred statically at opset 17.

    Conv's weight is therefore inherently a ``fake_quant=False`` feature,
    which is also what makes it cheap: the fake-quant path reads a weight as
    a 2-D grid of scale blocks (:func:`_blocked_shapes`), and none of that
    runs here.

    Rank is otherwise left alone -- a Conv's weight is
    ``[M, C/group, *kernel]``, rank 3 for a 1-D convolution and 5 for a 3-D
    one, and the training machinery is indifferent to which: the master
    weight is fed to the block's own node in the layout that node already
    reads, Adam's moments are ``zeros_like`` it, and the write-back stores it
    back unchanged. Only fp32 is still required, because the state tensors
    the loop carries are fp32.

    A weight of rank < 2 is skipped rather than trained: nothing here would
    break on one, but no MatMul, Gemm or Conv has a rank-1 weight, so such a
    tensor is something this function has misidentified.

    its rounded value, so a formulation that hid the rounding inside one op
    -- or that "simplified" the round trip to the identity it almost is --
    would have nothing left to differentiate.

    **Why the gradients are not written out here.** :mod:`onnxsim.adaquant`
    derives them by hand:
    ``d(xdq)/ds = (xq - zp) - active * x/s``, ``d(xdq)/d(zp) = s * (active -
    1)``, ``d/d(log s) = s * d/ds``, and a straight-through ``d(xdq)/dx =
    active``. Every one of those falls out of
    :mod:`onnxsim.graph_grad`'s ordinary rules applied to the chain below,

    structural rather than asserted -- which is the one trick here:

        ``round(r)`` is emitted as ``r + residual`` where ``residual =
        round(r) - r`` is computed by nodes deliberately left **out** of the
        differentiated list.

    A tensor no differentiated node produces is a leaf, so the backward walk
    stops at it and the ``Add``'s other operand receives the whole incoming
    gradient -- which is exactly what "the derivative of round is 1" means.
    Include those two nodes instead and the residual's own ``-r`` cancels the
    ``+r``, leaving a zero gradient: the failure mode this shape exists to
    avoid. ``tests/test_qat.py`` checks the emitted gradients against
    adaquant's closed form rather than trusting the argument.

    The scale is read as ``exp(log_scale)`` inside the differentiated chain,
    so the log-space chain rule is the ``Exp`` rule and not a hand-applied

    reconstruction loss, backward, optimizer.

    ``optimizer`` (``"adam"`` or ``"sgd_momentum"``) picks what the *block's
    own weight* update looks like -- see :func:`apply_qat`'s docstring for
    the full scope boundary. It never reaches the LSQ scale update or the
    activation-quantizer updates below (the ``learn_scales``/
    ``learn_activation_scales`` extras): those are always Adam, unconditionally.
    With the default ``"adam"``, every node this function emits -- including
    which scalars it declares and which state tensors it threads -- is
    byte-identical to what it emitted before this parameter existed.

    The ordering is the only subtle part. :func:`graph_grad.build_backward`
    reads forward tensors by name (including node *outputs*, where reusing a
    ``Sigmoid``/``Softmax`` result is cheaper than recomputing it), so every
    node it differentiates must already sit in the builder ahead of the nodes
    it appends. Hence: (optionally the minibatch gather,) fake-quant, then the
    block's own nodes verbatim, then the loss seed, then the backward, then
    the optimizer.

    With ``learn_activation_scales`` the ordering gains one more rule: each
    trained layer's activation fake-quant is spliced in immediately before
    the layer that reads it, and its differentiable half joins the list
    handed to the backward. The block's other nodes are untouched, so the
    two features compose without either knowing about the other.

    With ``fake_quant=False`` step 1 disappears instead: the block's node
    reads the master weight itself, the loop is plain gradient descent on the
    block's weights, and everything else here -- the teacher, the loss, the
    backward, Adam, the minibatch -- is the same graph it always was. What
    makes that a *fine-tuner* rather than a no-op is that the teacher and the
    student are different models: the student is the pruned, simplified or
    otherwise altered one, and the block is trained to reproduce what the
    original produced at that point.

    ``preserve_sparsity`` adds one ``Mul`` per trained layer, zeroing the
    weight gradient wherever the master weight started at zero. That is enough
    to hold those elements at zero exactly, rather than merely near it: with a
    gradient of 0 every step, Adam's ``m`` and ``v`` stay 0, its step is
    ``lr * 0 / (sqrt(0) + eps)`` -- exactly 0 -- and the parameter never moves.
    No clean-up pass at the end, and no drift in between.

    ``simplify`` is forwarded to :func:`qat_graph.make_step_graph` unchanged
    -- see that function's own docstring. The one caller in this repo that
    needs ``False`` is ``scripts/make_qat_parity_fixtures.py``'s
    ``_case_planner``, which pins this function's *raw* emission against
    ``onnxsim/qat_entry.cpp``'s hand-ported equivalent (a C++ implementation
    that, like ``qat_graph_builder.cpp``, never links onnx-optimizer); every
    other caller wants the default.

    ``externals`` and ``block_output_shape`` are always the *whole*
    calibration set's arrays and shape. With ``batch`` set they become the
    resident tables rather than the block's inputs, and the block's own
    tensors are ``batch.size`` rows gathered out of them -- so every shape
    from the block input downwards, the loss normalizer included, is a
    batch-sized shape, and none of the code below has to know which case it
    is in.

    output for that block -- label-free, teacher-distilled QAT. See this
    module's own docstring for the technique, what it refuses, and what it
    does not claim.

    The block is named the way :func:`onnxsim.apply_brecq` names one, by its
    input and output tensor. Unlike ``apply_brecq``, whatever lies between
    them is fair game as long as :mod:`onnxsim.graph_grad` has a rule for it
    -- an activation, a normalization, a GELU, a Softmax, a residual -- and
    unlike every rounding pass here, the fp32 weights themselves are what
    gets optimized.

    :param float_model: the original (unquantized) onnx ModelProto or file
            path. It is the teacher: its activations at
            ``block_output_name`` are the only target, and its weights seed
            the trained master weights.
    :param quantized_model: a quantized version of ``float_model`` (onnx
            ModelProto or file path), produced by
            :func:`onnxsim.quantize_weight_only_int4` -- or, with
            ``learn_activation_scales=True``, by
            :func:`onnxsim.quantize_static`. Layers quantized by any other
            scheme (or left unquantized) are left untouched, and a block
            containing none of them is an error rather than a no-op.
            Assumes ``quantized_model`` was produced from ``float_model``
            without renaming any MatMul/Gemm node's own output tensor -- true
            of every onnxsim ``quantize_*`` function.
    :param block_input_name: the activation entering the block. The backward
            walk that discovers the block's nodes stops here.
    :param block_output_name: the block's own final output, the tensor whose
            reconstruction error is the loss. Nothing stops these two names
            from being the graph's own input and its own output: that makes
            the block the whole model and the loss the model's own output
            error, which is the end-to-end pass rather than a surrogate for
            it. See this module's docstring for what that was measured to
            cost and to buy, and why it is not what
            :func:`apply_qat_all_blocks` does by default.
    :param calibration_data: representative input batches. Each batch is a
            ``{input_name: np.ndarray}`` dict matching ``float_model``'s graph
            inputs -- see :func:`onnxsim.generate_random_calibration_data`
            (the default when omitted) and
            :func:`onnxsim.load_huggingface_calibration_data` (real data, a
            far more representative target than random input). All batches
            are concatenated into one full-batch objective, so their shapes
            may differ only in the leading axis.
    :param num_samples: random batches to generate when ``calibration_data``
            is omitted
    :param seed: seed for the random calibration data (ignored if
            ``calibration_data`` is supplied)
    :param num_iterations: Adam steps -- optimizer steps -- to run over the
            block. That meaning is unchanged by ``batch_size``: it has always
            been the number of times the parameters are updated, and it still
            is. What ``batch_size`` changes is how much data each of those
            steps sees, and therefore how many *epochs* the same budget buys:
            with ``R`` calibration rows, a run covers
            ``num_iterations * batch_size / R`` epochs (full batch is
            ``batch_size = R``, hence exactly ``num_iterations`` epochs, one
            per step). So halving the batch size at a fixed
            ``num_iterations`` halves the data seen and the compute spent; to
            hold the *epoch* count fixed while minibatching, scale
            ``num_iterations`` up by ``R / batch_size``. ``lr_decay``
            likewise anneals over ``num_iterations`` steps regardless.
    :param learning_rate: Adam learning rate for the fp32 master weights.
            The natural scale to compare it against is the quantization step
            itself: an element has to travel about half a step to change
            which integer it rounds to, so ``num_iterations *
            learning_rate`` well below the typical step size means nothing
            can move at all, and well above it means everything thrashes.
    :param learn_scales: also train each weight's per-block quantization
            scale, LSQ-style. Off by default because it makes the problem
            non-convex in two coupled parameter sets at once (the same
            caution :mod:`onnxsim.autoround` documents) and because it
            rewrites the scale initializers, which the weight-only path
            leaves byte-identical.
    :param scale_learning_rate: Adam learning rate for the scales when
            ``learn_scales`` is on. Smaller than ``learning_rate`` by
            default: one scale is shared by a whole block of weights, so a
            step of the same size is a far larger change to the model.
    :param learn_activation_scales: also train the *activation* quantizers
            -- each trained layer's own input (scale, zero_point) pair --
            LSQ-style, jointly with the weights. **This selects the target
            scheme**, which is the part to read before turning it on.

            *Which scheme, and why there is no choice.* onnxsim produces two
            static schemes this pass could plausibly aim at.
            :func:`onnxsim.quantize_weight_only_int4` (the default target,
            everything above) quantizes weights only: its activations are
            fp32, it has no activation quantizer anywhere, and there is
            therefore no parameter to train and no initializer to write a
            trained one back into. "Activation quantization on top of it"
            would mean *inserting* quantizers -- inventing a W4A8 model no
            ``quantize_*`` function here emits and no deployment story
            expects -- which is a quantizer's job, not a fine-tuner's. So
            this targets :func:`onnxsim.quantize_static`'s QDQ scheme
            instead: uint8 asymmetric activations
            (``QuantizeLinear``/``DequantizeLinear`` around each quantized
            node's input) and per-output-channel symmetric INT8 weights. That
            is the same scheme :func:`onnxsim.apply_adaquant` targets, for the
            same reason, and this reuses adaquant's straight-through
            derivation of the activation gradients rather than re-deriving
            them.

            *It follows that this flag also changes what the weights are.*
            A ``quantize_static`` model's weights are per-channel INT8, so
            with the flag on that is what the fp32 master weights are
            fake-quantized against; the INT4 grid and its 32-element blocks
            are simply not present in such a model. Weight training is
            unchanged in every other respect, and the two parameter groups
            are trained *jointly* on one loss -- which is AdaQuant's own
            argument for why it is worth doing at all: the reconstruction
            error is a joint function of both, and a weight choice that is
            optimal against one activation clip range is not optimal against
            another.

            *Which tensors get a trained quantizer.* Exactly one per trained
            layer: the quantizer on that layer's own activation input, where
            ``quantize_static`` put it. It is trained per *edge*, not per
            tensor -- two layers reading the same activation have two
            independent QDQ pairs in the deployed model and get two
            independent trained quantizers here. A layer in the block whose
            input has no QDQ pair is not a candidate at all (it is not a
            ``quantize_static`` layer), and a block with no candidates is
            refused rather than silently trained weight-only.

            *What training the block input's quantizer means, precisely.*
            The block's input activation is teacher-forced: the value fed in
            is the float model's, not the student's. The quantizer, though,
            sits **inside** the block -- ``QuantizeLinear`` consumes the
            block's input tensor and feeds the first layer -- so it is
            genuinely this block's parameter to train, and training it is not
            a boundary violation. What it *is* is a clip range fitted to the
            teacher's distribution of that tensor rather than the student's.
            Those coincide exactly at the model's own graph input, and drift
            apart deeper in the model as upstream quantization error
            accumulates. :func:`apply_qat_all_blocks` with ``sequential=True``
            (the default) closes that gap by re-running the student before
            each block, which matters more with this flag on than without it:
            a clip range is a property of the input distribution in a way a
            weight is not.

            Off by default, and not only for compatibility: it is a harder,
            non-convex problem in two coupled parameter groups (the caution
            :mod:`onnxsim.autoround` documents for its own clip ratio), it
            rewrites activation initializers a weight-only run leaves
            untouched, and it applies to a different quantized model
            entirely. Turning it on over a
            ``quantize_weight_only_int4`` model raises
            :class:`ValueError` naming the mismatch.

            *And it is measured rather than assumed.* On a block whose
            activation range was calibrated from one unrepresentative
            outlier it takes the whole-model output error 38% below what
            training the weights alone reaches; on the same block calibrated
            on representative data it is a regression at every learning
            rate tried, because min/max on
            representative data is already close to MSE-optimal and a second
            coupled parameter group makes a solved problem harder.
            ``tests/test_qat.py`` records both, with the numbers. Use it when
            the calibrated range is wrong -- and note that re-calibrating,
            when that is available, costs one forward pass rather than a
            training budget.
    :param activation_learning_rate: Adam learning rate for the activation
            scale (optimized in log space, so it can never reach zero or go
            negative) and its zero-point, when ``learn_activation_scales`` is
            on. Larger than ``scale_learning_rate`` by default because it is
            a *log*-space step for the scale and a step in uint8 codes for
            the zero-point -- neither is measured in the units the weight
            learning rate is.
    :param lr_decay: anneal every one of the learning rates above
            (weight, weight scale, activation quantizer) linearly to zero
            across the run. On by default because the objective is piecewise constant in
            the master weights -- the loss only moves when an element crosses
            a rounding boundary -- so a constant learning rate leaves the
            final iterate wherever the last step happened to put it, which
            can be worse than a step earlier. Annealing makes the end of the
            run settle instead. Turn it off to hold the rate fixed.
    :param batch_size: rows of the calibration set each step trains on.
            ``None``, the default, is full batch -- every step sees every
            row, which is what this module has always done and which stays
            bit-for-bit unchanged, ``Gather``-free graph included, because a
            full-batch run does not take the minibatching path at all. A
            ``batch_size`` at least as large as the row count is the same
            thing and takes the same path.

            What minibatching is *for*, stated honestly: a step's cost stops
            scaling with the size of the calibration set, so a larger set
            costs more epochs rather than a bigger, slower step -- and each
            pass over the data now performs ``R / batch_size`` updates
            instead of one, which is the ordinary reason stochastic gradient
            descent converges in fewer passes than full-batch descent. What
            it is *not*: a way to train on more data than fits in memory. The
            whole set is still one static tensor, resident on the execution
            provider's device, out of which each step gathers its rows --
            see :mod:`onnxsim.qat_graph`'s module docstring for that
            trade-off and the alternative that was not taken.

            The loss recorded in ``losses`` becomes the *batch's* loss, not
            the set's, so it is noisy: compare a smoothed tail against a
            smoothed head, not the last value against the first.
    :param shuffle: draw a fresh permutation of the rows each epoch, so
            consecutive steps see different rows rather than the same fixed
            partition every time round. On by default, and only meaningful
            when ``batch_size`` is set. ``False`` walks the rows in order,
            which is for reproducing a specific batch composition (a test, a
            debugging session) rather than for training.
    :param batch_seed: seed for that shuffling. Deliberately its own
            parameter rather than a second use of ``seed``: ``seed`` picks
            the random *calibration data* and is documented as ignored when
            the caller supplies their own, whereas the batch order matters in
            exactly the case where the caller did supply data. Two runs with
            the same ``batch_seed`` see identical batches in identical order.
            Batches are a pure function of ``(batch_seed, step index)``, not
            of a running generator, so an interrupted run resumes on the same
            schedule.
    :param providers: onnxruntime execution providers to run ``float_model``
            on when capturing the teacher's activations
    :param step_providers: onnxruntime execution providers to run the
            optimization itself on, as an ONNX step graph
            (:mod:`onnxsim.qat_graph`) -- the way to reach a GPU, an NPU
            execution provider, or WebGPU with this loop. ``None`` means CPU.
            Unlike :func:`onnxsim.apply_adaround`, there is no host-numpy
            alternative here: the step graph *is* the implementation, so this
            selects where it runs rather than whether it is used.
    :param losses: when given, the reconstruction loss is appended to it once
            per step -- the cheapest way to see whether a block actually
            trained, and what the tests here assert on.
    :param preserve_sparsity: hold every weight element that starts at zero
            at zero for the whole run. Off by default, and it is the caller's
            call rather than a detected one, because "this element is zero" and
            "this element was pruned away" are the same bit pattern and only
            the caller knows which they meant.

            **Turn it on for an unstructured-pruned model.** Nothing else in
            the step graph masks the optimizer, so without it a pruned zero
            gets a gradient like any other element and leaves zero on the very
            first step: measured at 50% sparsity, 128 zeros per weight before
            and none after, while the loss fell five orders of magnitude. Every
            signal a caller would look at says that run went well, which is
            what makes it worth a parameter rather than a note.

            Structured pruning needs nothing here -- there the channel is gone
            from the tensor rather than zeroed inside it.

            The mask is the zero pattern of the weight the optimizer *starts*
            from, which is the master weight's seed: the student's own weight
            when fine-tuning, and the float model's when quantizing (so for
            QAT over a pruned model, prune first and pass the pruned model as
            ``float_model``, which is the ordinary order anyway). Elements it
            holds are held exactly, not approximately -- see
            :func:`_build_step_graph` for why one ``Mul`` is enough.
    :param fake_quant: with ``False``, drop the fake-quantizer and train the
            *second model's own float weights* directly. Everything else --
            the teacher, the reconstruction loss, the backward, Adam, the
            minibatch -- is unchanged, so this is the same block-wise,
            label-free distillation with the quantizer taken out of the
            middle: plain fine-tuning. :func:`apply_block_finetune` is this with a
            name that says so and without the parameters that stop meaning
            anything; prefer it, and see its docstring for when the two
            models differ enough for there to be something to learn.
            Incompatible with ``learn_scales`` and
            ``learn_activation_scales``, which have no scales to learn.
    :param optimizer: which optimizer trains the block's own weight --
            ``"adam"`` (the default) or ``"sgd_momentum"`` (classic
            heavy-ball momentum SGD, :func:`onnxsim.qat_graph.sgd_momentum_update`).
            **This is deliberately scoped to the weight alone.** When
            ``learn_scales`` and/or ``learn_activation_scales`` are also on,
            their LSQ scale / activation-quantizer parameters always train
            with Adam, regardless of what ``optimizer`` says -- so
            ``optimizer="sgd_momentum"`` with ``learn_scales=True`` trains
            the weight with SGD-momentum and the scale with Adam, in the same
            run. That is not an oversight: Adam's per-parameter state is two
            tensors shaped like the parameter (``m``, ``v``) plus two
            step-dependent bias-correction scalars, while SGD-momentum's is
            one tensor and no scalars, so a *uniform* optimizer choice across
            weight, scale and activation quantizer would mean plumbing that
            same either/or through three independently-shaped parameter
            groups instead of one -- a materially larger change for a
            feature nothing has asked to extend past the weight, which is
            also the one parameter every trained block always has (the scale
            and activation-quantizer state exist only when their own opt-in
            flags are on). Raises :class:`ValueError` if ``optimizer`` is
            neither of the two recognized strings.
    :param teacher_forced_inputs: capture ``block_input_name`` and every
            other externally-supplied tensor the block reads (see
            :func:`_slice_block`) from ``float_model``, the default and the
            approximation every block-wise reconstruction method here makes
            (see this module's own docstring). Set to ``False`` to instead
            capture them from ``quantized_model`` -- ``block_output_name``'s
            target is still captured from ``float_model`` either way, since
            reproducing the teacher's output is always the objective.

            **This is what makes the block able to compensate for a change
            upstream of it, not only inside it.** With the default
            (``True``), training only ever sees the *teacher's* activation
            entering the block, so it can only fix something the two models
            disagree about *inside* the block (a quantized/pruned/rewritten
            weight) -- if the block's own weights already agree, the loss is
            zero from the first step and nothing trains, no matter how
            different ``quantized_model``'s upstream computation is,
            because the mismatch never reaches the block at all. With
            ``False``, the block is trained on exactly the (possibly
            distorted) activation it will actually receive at inference --
            e.g. a Resize node upstream of the block having its ``mode``/
            ``coordinate_transformation_mode`` swapped for a deployment
            accelerator, which :func:`onnxsim.correct_bias`/
            :func:`onnxsim.correct_spatial_bias` can only partially cancel
            (a constant or coarse spatial offset, not a real function of the
            input) -- so the block's weights can learn an actual
            compensating function of that distortion instead.
    :returns: ``quantized_model`` with the block's quantized weight

    with the tensor that survives it.

    This is the whole of boundary discovery, and it is a liveness argument
    rather than a pattern match. Walk the nodes in their (topological) graph
    order and track which tensors are *live* at each gap between node ``p``
    and node ``p + 1``: produced at or before ``p``, and still read after it
    (a graph output counts as read by the outside world). A gap where exactly
    one tensor is live is a place the graph can be cut without severing
    anything else, so the slice on either side is self-contained -- which is
    precisely the property :func:`_slice_block` needs its two boundaries to
    have.

    The pleasant consequence is that residual connections *place* the
    boundaries instead of defeating them. Inside ``y = f(x) + x`` the skip
    tensor ``x`` is live alongside every intermediate, so no gap in the middle
    of the residual is a cut, and the first cut after ``x`` is the residual
    ``Add``'s own output -- exactly where a person would have drawn the block
    boundary of a ResNet BasicBlock or a transformer sub-layer, derived rather
    than special-cased.

    Two things are excluded from the live set:

    - **Initializers.** They are not activations; every block gets its own
      copy in its step graph.
    - **Graph inputs other than** ``primary_input``. A second graph input --
      an attention mask, a position id tensor -- is byte-identical in the
      teacher and the student, so teacher-forcing it into a block is exact
      rather than an approximation, and letting it span the whole graph would
      otherwise suppress every cut in a model that has one.

    ``primary_input`` itself is *kept* in the live set, so a residual from the
    model's own input still binds a block together (and its block ends at the
    residual's output, not before it).

    What this cannot see: a tensor computed purely from initializers -- a
    pre-transposed weight shared by several layers, say -- is counted as an
    ordinary live activation, so it suppresses cuts across its whole live
    range. That is conservative in the safe direction (fewer, larger blocks,

    This is the piece ``docs/qat.md`` lists as missing and
    :mod:`onnxsim.brecq`'s docstring explicitly declines to attempt ("the
    caller identifies a block by two tensor names"). BRECQ's reason was that
    auto-detection looked architecture-specific; it is not, once the question
    is asked in the right terms. Two properties make a slice trainable, and
    both are decidable from the graph:

    1. **Differentiable.** Every op inside must be in
       :data:`onnxsim.graph_grad.SUPPORTED_OPS`, since the step graph
       contains a backward pass over the block's own nodes.
    2. **Self-contained.** The block must be cuttable out of the graph
       without severing an activation that some other part of the graph is
       still using. :func:`_liveness_cuts` finds exactly those places, by
       liveness rather than by recognizing architectures -- read its
       docstring, it is the substance of this function.

    Blocks are then the spans between consecutive cuts, with two adjustments:

    - **Unsupported ops become gaps, not failures.** A span containing an op
      with no gradient rule cannot be a block, so it is skipped and the next
      block starts after it. A model with one ``Sin`` in the middle trains
      everything either side of it instead of being refused outright, which
      is the behaviour that makes whole-model QAT usable at all; the
      alternative -- :func:`apply_qat`'s loud refusal -- is right for a
      caller who *named* a block and wrong for a caller who named none.
    - **Spans are merged up to** ``max_layers_per_block`` **quantized
      layers.** A cut exists between every pair of layers in a plain MLP, so
      without merging every block would be a single layer and the whole point
      of block-wise reconstruction (letting layers inside a block cancel each
      other's error, :mod:`onnxsim.brecq`'s own argument) would be lost. The
      default of 2 is the paired-projection shape BRECQ's Section 4 targets
      -- a ResNet BasicBlock's two convolutions, a transformer FFN's up/down
      pair. A span with no quantized layer in it (a lone activation) never
      closes a block; it is absorbed into the next one.

    **What discovery cannot see, and therefore does not promise.** It never
    runs the model, so it cannot know whether a block's shapes are statically
    inferable -- a dynamic ``Reshape``, a symbolic dimension that survives
    inference -- and a block that fails on that is discovered here and
    skipped later, by :func:`apply_qat_all_blocks`, with the reason recorded.
    It also has no notion of which blocks *matter*: it will happily propose a
    block whose quantization error is already negligible, and it has no
    sensitivity metric to rank them (:mod:`onnxsim.precision_estimator` is
    where such a thing would come from). And it inherits every limit of
    :func:`_liveness_cuts`: a graph with a long-lived constant-derived tensor,
    or with multi-output branches that never reconverge, simply yields fewer
    or no cuts, and therefore fewer or no blocks -- an empty plan, not an
    error.

    :param float_model: the teacher, as an onnx ModelProto or a file path.
            Boundaries are found in *this* graph, since it is the one whose
            nodes the step graph differentiates.

            counterpart, used only to find which layers are actually
            quantized -- a block must contain at least one.
    :param max_layers_per_block: how many quantized layers to merge into one
            block before closing it. 1 gives per-layer blocks (more, cheaper
            steps, no intra-block error cancellation); a large value gives
            one block per gap between undifferentiable ops -- and on a model
            with no such gap, one block spanning the whole graph, which is
            the end-to-end objective itself rather than a surrogate for it.
            This module's docstring records why that is reachable but not
            the default.
    :param learn_activation_scales: plan for :func:`apply_qat`'s
            activation-quantization mode, i.e. count
            :func:`onnxsim.quantize_static` QDQ layers as the quantized ones
            rather than ``quantize_weight_only_int4`` INT4 layers. It has to
            be said here as well as at training time because "which layers
            are quantized" is what closes a block: the same graph partitions
            differently under the two schemes, and a plan made for one is
            not a plan for the other.
    :returns: the blocks in graph order, possibly empty. Consecutive blocks
            need not be adjacent: a gap between two of them is a region
            nothing here can train.

    """Trains every block :func:`discover_qat_blocks` finds, in graph order --
    :func:`apply_qat` lifted from one caller-named block to the whole model.

    **The design decision that matters: where each block's input comes
    from.** Every block's optimization *target* is the teacher's output for
    that block; that is not in question and is what makes this label-free.
    The question is what to feed the block's input, and there are two honest
    answers:

    - ``sequential=True`` (**the default**): re-run the *student* -- the
      quantized model as tuned so far -- before each block, and feed that
      block the activation the deployed model will actually present to it.
      Block *k* therefore sees the error blocks 0..k-1 left behind and spends
      its own capacity correcting it, while still aiming at the teacher's
      clean output. This is the standard sequential block-reconstruction
      setup, and it is the reason the walk is worth more than *N* independent
      calls to :func:`apply_qat`. It costs one forward pass of the student
      per block -- inference, not training, and negligible beside
      ``num_iterations`` optimizer steps.
    - ``sequential=False``: capture everything once, from the float model,
      before any block is touched. This is what :mod:`onnxsim.adaround` and
      :mod:`onnxsim.brecq` do, and it is cheaper by exactly one forward pass
      per block. It is also strictly the *independence assumption*
      :mod:`onnxsim.brecq`'s own docstring identifies as the flaw in
      per-layer reconstruction, applied one level up: it assumes every
      earlier block was reconstructed perfectly, so a later block optimizes
      against an input the deployed model never produces.

    Sequential is the default because the assumption it drops is known to be
    false -- quantization error compounds down a network, that is the entire
    premise of block reconstruction. It is not, however, a free win:
    ``tests/test_qat.py`` measures both modes on a deliberately
    error-compounding model and records which one actually won, rather than
    asserting the expected direction. On a shallow model with small
    quantization error the two modes land within noise of each other, and on
    any model the sequential input is *noisier* -- the student's activation
    carries the earlier blocks' residual error, which acts a little like
    input jitter. That is usually a regularizer and occasionally a handicap.

    **Failures are per block, not per model.** A block that cannot be trained
    -- an op with no gradient rule that discovery could not have foreseen, a
    shape that will not infer statically, a slice with no quantized layer --
    is skipped, the reason is recorded in its :class:`QATBlockResult`, and
    the walk continues. That is the opposite of :func:`apply_qat`, which
    refuses loudly, and the difference is deliberate: refusing loudly is
    right when the caller *named* the thing that cannot be trained, and wrong
    when they named nothing and one block out of forty is unusual. Nothing is
    dropped silently -- every discovered block appears in the returned list,
    trained or not.

    :param float_model: the teacher (onnx ModelProto or file path). Its
            activations are every block's target and its weights seed every
            block's trained master weights.
    :param quantized_model: its :func:`onnxsim.quantize_weight_only_int4`
            counterpart -- the student, and the model that is returned with
            its INT4 initializers rewritten.
    :param blocks: the plan to walk. ``None`` runs :func:`discover_qat_blocks`
            with ``max_layers_per_block``. Pass an explicit list to inspect,
            filter or reorder the plan first -- e.g. to train only the blocks
            a sensitivity analysis flagged.
    :param calibration_data: representative input batches, as
            :func:`apply_qat` takes them. All batches are concatenated into
            one full-batch objective per block.
    :param num_samples: random batches to generate when ``calibration_data``
            is omitted
    :param seed: seed for that random calibration data
    :param num_iterations: Adam (optimizer) steps per block, exactly as in
            :func:`apply_qat` -- see there for how ``batch_size`` relates
            steps to epochs. The total budget is this times the number of
            blocks, so a whole-model walk usually wants a smaller value than
            a single :func:`apply_qat` call would.
    :param learning_rate: Adam learning rate for the fp32 master weights
    :param learn_scales: also train each weight's per-block quantization
            scale, LSQ-style, in every block
    :param scale_learning_rate: Adam learning rate for those scales
    :param learn_activation_scales: train each block's activation quantizers
            alongside its weights, which also selects
            :func:`onnxsim.quantize_static`'s QDQ scheme as the target -- see
            :func:`apply_qat`, where the whole decision is written down. It is
            passed to :func:`discover_qat_blocks` as well when ``blocks`` is
            not given, since which layers count as quantized is what closes a
            block. This mode is where ``sequential=True`` earns the most: a
            clip range fitted to the teacher's activation distribution is a
            worse fit for the student's than a weight is, so re-running the
            student before each block matters more here than in the
            weight-only case.
    :param activation_learning_rate: Adam learning rate for those activation
            scales and zero-points
    :param lr_decay: anneal every learning rate to zero within each block
    :param batch_size: rows per optimizer step, applied identically in every
            block -- ``None`` (the default) is full batch, unchanged. Note
            that the blocks share the *same* batch schedule, since each is
            trained by its own :func:`apply_qat`-equivalent loop starting from
            step 0 with the same ``batch_seed``; the rows are the same rows,
            because every block's activations were captured from the same
            calibration inputs in the same order, so block ``k`` and block
            ``k+1`` agree about what "row 7" means.
    :param shuffle: shuffle the rows per epoch, as :func:`apply_qat` does
    :param batch_seed: seed for that shuffling
    :param sequential: feed each block the student's own activation rather
            than the teacher's -- see above. ``True`` by default.
    :param max_layers_per_block: passed to :func:`discover_qat_blocks` when
            ``blocks`` is not given
    :param providers: execution providers for the activation captures (both
            the teacher's and, in sequential mode, the student's)
    :param step_providers: execution providers for the optimization itself,
            as an ONNX step graph -- the path to CUDA/ROCm (including
            MIGraphX), an NPU EP or WebGPU
    :param optimizer: which optimizer trains each block's own weight --
            ``"adam"`` (the default) or ``"sgd_momentum"``, applied
            identically to every block in the walk. Scoped to the weight
            alone, exactly as in :func:`apply_qat`: with ``learn_scales``
            and/or ``learn_activation_scales`` also on, every block's scale
            and activation-quantizer parameters still train with Adam
            regardless of this choice -- see :func:`apply_qat`'s own
            ``optimizer`` paragraph for why that boundary was drawn where it
            was. Raises :class:`ValueError` if ``optimizer`` is neither of
            the two recognized strings.
    :returns: ``(tuned model, one QATBlockResult per discovered block)``. The
            model is ``quantized_model`` with every successfully trained
            block's initializers rewritten and nothing else touched; if no
            block trained it is an unmodified copy.

    """Fine-tunes one block's float weights against a *reference* model's own
    output for that block -- :func:`apply_qat` with the quantizer taken out of
    the middle.

    Everything that made QAT here work is about distillation rather than about
    quantization: a block, a teacher's activation at its output, a mean
    squared reconstruction error, a backward pass emitted as ONNX, an Adam
    step. Quantization only ever entered at one point -- the fake-quantizer
    between the master weight and the block's node -- and removing it leaves
    ordinary block-wise fine-tuning. No labels, no loss function to choose, no
    training framework: the same step graph, run the same way, on whatever
    execution provider ``step_providers`` names.

    **The two models must differ somewhere the training actually sees, or
    there is nothing to learn.** With the default ``teacher_forced_inputs``
    (see :func:`apply_qat`, which this forwards to), the block always trains
    on the *reference's* own activation entering it, so what has to differ
    is the block's own weights -- a student that already has the
    reference's weights there starts at zero loss and stays there. This is
    for the case where something has already changed the model's weights
    and the change cost accuracy:

    - a **structurally** pruned model
      (:func:`onnxsim.apply_structured_pruning`,
      :func:`onnxsim.apply_attention_head_pruning` and friends), whose
      remaining weights can absorb some of what the removed ones did.
      *Unstructured* pruning
      (:func:`onnxsim.apply_magnitude_pruning`,
      :func:`onnxsim.apply_wanda_pruning`) is the case to avoid rather than
      the case to reach for: nothing here masks the optimizer, so every zero
      pruning left behind gets a gradient like any other element and is
      filled back in on the first step. Measured at 50% sparsity: 128 zeros
      per weight before, none after, while the loss fell five orders of
      magnitude -- so no signal a caller would look at says anything went
      wrong. See ``test_unstructured_sparsity_is_not_preserved``;
    - a model whose weights were quantized and dequantized back to fp32, or
      rewritten by any of this package's rounding passes;
    - a model already fine-tuned once, being tuned further against the
      original.

    **With ``teacher_forced_inputs=False``,** the requirement moves upstream:
    now it is ``model``'s own computation *before* the block that has to
    differ from ``reference_model``'s, since that is what the block actually
    trains against. This is for a change upstream of any trainable layer --
    e.g. a Resize node's ``mode``/``coordinate_transformation_mode`` swapped
    for a deployment accelerator, which leaves the block's own weights
    identical between the two models (so the default, teacher-forced mode
    is a guaranteed no-op here: see :func:`apply_qat`'s own docstring for
    why) but changes what the block actually receives at inference.

    **What this actually needs is downstream capacity, not proximity.**
    Measured on a Resize mode swap (``linear`` -> ``nearest``) at three
    positions in a small Conv stack, against the same held-out set
    :func:`onnxsim.correct_spatial_bias` measured ~0% (or, with two more
    Conv+ReLU stages between the swap and the trained block, ~2.5% *worse*
    -- see that function's own module docstring) reduction on regardless of
    position: with three trainable Conv layers between the swap and the
    model's own output, ``teacher_forced_inputs=False`` recovered ~61%;
    with only *one* trainable layer there, ~57% -- almost the same recovery
    from far less remaining capacity, because one layer was already enough
    to express a useful compensating function of this particular
    distortion. The one configuration where it recovered nothing was not
    "far from the swap" but **no trainable block at all**: with the Resize
    as the model's own last op, there is no ``block_output_name`` downstream
    of it to name, so there is nothing this parameter -- or any block-wise
    method -- can be pointed at. That is a real ceiling worth knowing before
    reaching for this: it is not a matter of degree that a longer run or a
    different block boundary works around.

    It is *not* a way to fine-tune on new data or a new task: the objective is
    "reproduce what the reference model produced", which by construction
    cannot exceed the reference. Fitting a different target needs a different
    loss, and this module has one loss.

    **Against :func:`onnxsim.apply_pruning_finetune`,** which solves the same
    kind of problem and should usually be tried first for pruning. That one
    fits each layer *individually* and in *closed form* -- one ridge
    regression, one linear solve, no iteration, no learning rate, and an
    exactness argument this has no equivalent of. It is strictly better
    wherever it applies. What it cannot do is what a block buys: a layer
    pruned on both its input and its output channels at once is outside its
    channel-correspondence reconstruction and it declines to touch it, and a
    per-layer least-squares fit cannot let two layers with a nonlinearity
    between them trade error off against each other, because that objective
    is not a linear least-squares problem at all. This is the general,
    slower, weaker-guarantee alternative for those cases -- and, unlike a
    numpy solve, it is a step graph, so it runs on whatever
    ``step_providers`` names.

    :param reference_model: the teacher (onnx ModelProto or file path). Its
            activation at ``block_output_name`` is the only target. Its
            weights are *not* used to seed anything -- unlike
            :func:`apply_qat`, where the student's weights are a lossy
            encoding of the teacher's and so seeding from the teacher is the
            warm start. Here the student's weights are the starting point
            precisely because they are not the teacher's.
    :param model: the model being tuned (onnx ModelProto or file path). Every
            MatMul/Gemm in the block whose weight is a 2-D fp32 initializer is
            trained; the rest of the block is left alone, and a block with
            none of them is an error rather than a no-op. Assumed to have
            ``reference_model``'s topology and tensor names -- true of a
            pruned or requantized model, and the same assumption
            :func:`apply_qat` makes.
    :param block_input_name: the activation entering the block
    :param block_output_name: the block's own final output, the tensor whose
            reconstruction error is the loss
    :param calibration_data: representative input batches; see
            :func:`apply_qat`, whose meaning is unchanged
    :param num_samples: random batches to generate when ``calibration_data``
            is omitted
    :param seed: seed for that random calibration data
    :param num_iterations: Adam steps to run over the block
    :param learning_rate: Adam learning rate for the weights. The default is
            :func:`apply_qat`'s, and is a starting point rather than a
            recommendation: QAT's objective is piecewise constant in the
            master weights (the loss only moves when an element crosses a
            rounding boundary), and this one is not, so a rate tuned for one
            is not tuned for the other.
    :param lr_decay: anneal the learning rate linearly to zero across the run
    :param batch_size: rows of the calibration set each step trains on;
            ``None`` is full batch. See :func:`apply_qat`.
    :param shuffle: draw a fresh permutation of the rows each epoch
    :param batch_seed: seed for that shuffling
    :param providers: onnxruntime execution providers for capturing the
            reference's activations
    :param step_providers: onnxruntime execution providers to run the
            optimization itself on
    :param losses: when given, the reconstruction loss is appended once per
            step
    :param preserve_sparsity: hold every weight element that starts at zero
            at zero for the whole run. Off by default, and it is the caller's
            call rather than a detected one, because "this element is zero" and
            "this element was pruned away" are the same bit pattern and only
            the caller knows which they meant.

            **Turn it on for an unstructured-pruned model.** Nothing else in
            the step graph masks the optimizer, so without it a pruned zero
            gets a gradient like any other element and leaves zero on the very
            first step: measured at 50% sparsity, 128 zeros per weight before
            and none after, while the loss fell five orders of magnitude. Every
            signal a caller would look at says that run went well, which is
            what makes it worth a parameter rather than a note.

            Structured pruning needs nothing here -- there the channel is gone
            from the tensor rather than zeroed inside it.

            The mask is the zero pattern of the weight the optimizer *starts*
            from, which is the master weight's seed: the student's own weight
            when fine-tuning, and the float model's when quantizing (so for
            QAT over a pruned model, prune first and pass the pruned model as
            ``float_model``, which is the ordinary order anyway). Elements it
            holds are held exactly, not approximately -- see
            :func:`_build_step_graph` for why one ``Mul`` is enough.
    :param teacher_forced_inputs: see :func:`apply_qat`, which this
            forwards to unchanged. Leave at the default (``True``) to fix a
            block whose *own weights* changed (pruning, a rounding pass);
            set to ``False`` to fix a block whose weights are unchanged but
            whose *upstream input* changed (see this docstring's own "two
            models must differ" section above).
    :returns: ``model`` with the block's weight initializers rewritten. Every
            other byte is untouched.
    :raises ValueError: if the block cannot be discovered, is not closed at
            statically-known shapes, or contains no MatMul/Gemm with a 2-D

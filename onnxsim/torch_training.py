"""A *real* ``torch.compile``-styled training loop: export an actual
``torch.nn.Module`` to ONNX via ``torch.export``'s FX graph, then hand the
result to :func:`onnxsim.compile_training_loop`.

:mod:`onnxsim.compile_training` gives an ONNX model the ``torch.compile``
calling convention (lazy compile-once, run-many) without any torch
dependency at all -- the model has to already be an ONNX ``ModelProto``.
This module is the on-ramp from an actual PyTorch model: it captures
``module``'s forward as an FX graph with ``torch.export.export`` (what
``torch.compile`` itself, and ``torch.onnx.export``'s modern exporter, both
build on) and converts that graph to ONNX with
``torch.onnx.export(..., dynamo=True)`` -- the dynamo/FX-based exporter,
not the older TorchScript tracer. What comes out the other end is an
ordinary :class:`onnxsim.compile_training.TrainingLoop`: every step after
that runs on onnxsim's own :mod:`onnxsim.graph_grad`/:mod:`onnxsim.qat_graph`
machinery, never on ``torch.autograd`` -- the forward graph is torch's, the
backward pass and the optimizer are onnxsim's.

``module.forward`` must return a single scalar tensor -- the loss -- the
same requirement :func:`onnxsim.compile_training_loop` already has for
``loss_output``, and for the same reason: a step graph has exactly one loss
output. Put the loss computation inside the module (``forward(self, x, y):
... ; return loss``) rather than composing it outside; there is no separate
loss-function export path here.

An arbitrary (non-``torch.nn.functional``-builtin) loss function needs no
API of its own for the same reason: ``torch.export`` traces whatever
``forward`` calls, so any ordinary Python/torch function it calls -- a
custom loss included -- is traced right along with it. Wrap the model and
the loss together in one small module rather than writing the loss into the
model's own class::

    def my_loss(y_hat, y):
        # any torch expression built from ops graph_grad differentiates
        # (onnxsim.graph_grad.supported_ops()) -- see compile_torch_training_loop's
        # own docstring on diff * diff vs diff ** 2 for why that matters
        diff = y_hat - y
        return (diff * diff).mean()

    class WithLoss(torch.nn.Module):
        def __init__(self, model, loss_fn):
            super().__init__()
            self.model = model
            self.loss_fn = loss_fn

        def forward(self, x, y):
            return self.loss_fn(self.model(x), y)

    loop = onnxsim.compile_torch_training_loop(WithLoss(Regression(), my_loss), (x, y))

``WithLoss`` above is generic -- the same wrapper composes any ``model``
with any ``loss_fn`` -- so a project with several losses to try needs only
one such wrapper, not one module subclass per loss.

Needs ``torch >= 2.5`` (the ``onnxsim[torch-training]`` extra), the release
``torch.onnx.export``'s ``dynamo=True`` argument landed in. Not imported at
module load time -- only :func:`export_torch_module_to_onnx` and
:func:`compile_torch_training_loop` need it, and both raise a clear
:class:`ImportError` if it is missing rather than failing this module's own
import for every caller of :mod:`onnxsim.compile_training` who has no torch
installed at all.

    first risks folding away the very shape those two rely on seeing.

    - the ``Squeeze`` has no ``axes`` input either (meaning "every size-1
      axis" -- which, following an all-axes reduction, is every axis the
      reduce has).

    Any other combination -- an explicit ``axes`` on either node, more than
    one consumer, ``keepdims=0`` already -- is a real shape decision the

    specific decomposition artifact, not a general ``Squeeze`` eliminator.

    is elementwise; see :class:`~onnxsim.compile_training.CustomOptimizer`'s
    own docstring for the full reasoning and its limits. ``lr`` is traced as

    the loop goes through torch; running it does not need torch installed at

    CUDA or ROCm/HIP) directly, with no ``.numpy()`` needed and, when onnxruntime is

    ``diff * diff``, not ``diff ** 2``, in the example above is not a style

    target: preferring ops :func:`onnxsim.graph_grad.supported_ops` lists
    over ones that merely compute the same thing.

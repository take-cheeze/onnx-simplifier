"""llama.cpp's GGUF "Q6_K" K-quant format -- the block layout real
``.gguf`` quantization presets (``Q4_K_M``, ``Q5_K_M``, ...) use for their
highest-precision tensors (most commonly the output/``lm_head`` weight,
kept at 6 bits while every other weight goes to 4 or 5). Joins
:mod:`onnxsim.gguf_kquant` (Q4_K) as this repo's second member of the
K-quant family proper -- distinct from the plainer
:mod:`onnxsim.gguf_legacy_quant` (Q4_0/Q4_1, one flat scale per block, no
super-block) and :mod:`onnxsim.iq4_nl`/:mod:`onnxsim.gguf_ternary_quant`
(a fixed codebook or ternary code, not a re-quantized affine scale).

onnxsim already *reads* Q6_K when importing a GGUF checkpoint -- see
``onnxsim/ggml_kquant.h``'s ``DequantizeQ6_KBlock``, which this module's
own dequantization math is deliberately kept consistent with (the same
"verified against this repo's own existing decoder" discipline
:mod:`onnxsim.gguf_kquant`'s own docstring already documents). What has
been missing is the encoder direction.

**Q6_K's block structure**: a 256-element super-block is split into 16
sub-blocks of 16 elements. Each sub-block gets its own signed 8-bit scale
code ``sc_j`` (``[-128, 127]``, though this module's own encoder only ever
produces non-negative codes -- see below); one shared float16 super-block
scale ``d`` multiplies every sub-block's code before it is itself
multiplied by that sub-block's own element code. The element codes
themselves are **symmetric** 6-bit values (``[-32, 31]``, no separate
min/zero-point) -- unlike Q4_K/Q5_K's asymmetric ``d``/``dmin`` pair, Q6_K
is structurally closer to :mod:`onnxsim.gguf_legacy_quant`'s Q4_0, just
with a super-block's worth of per-sub-block scale variation layered on
top:

    dequant = d * sc_j * q,   q in [-32, 31],   sc_j in [-128, 127]

-- transcribed directly from, and cross-checked element-for-element
against, ``onnxsim/ggml_kquant.h``'s own ``DequantizeQ6_KBlock``.

**Honesty note**: as with :mod:`onnxsim.gguf_kquant`'s own Q4_K encoder,
what is verified here is the *dequantization* formula above (matching
this repo's own already-verified decoder); llama.cpp's own *encoder*
procedure for choosing each sub-block's ideal scale and requantizing it
to 8 bits was not available to read alongside the decoder. This module's
own encoder therefore uses the same straightforward, honestly-scoped
mechanism :mod:`onnxsim.gguf_kquant`'s Q4_K encoder already established:
for sub-block ``j``, ``ideal_scale_j = max(|sub_block_j|) / 32``, then
``d = max_j(ideal_scale_j) / 127`` (the super-block's shared float16
reference, chosen so the single largest sub-block scale maps to the top
of the 8-bit code range) and ``sc_j = round(ideal_scale_j / d)`` clamped
to ``[0, 127]``. Not claimed to be a byte-exact reproduction of
llama.cpp's own encoder, only its documented format's own reconstruction
semantics -- verified in this module's own test file with real numpy
arithmetic, not a recalled/assumed constant.

**Scope**: matches ``MatMul``/"vanilla" ``Gemm`` (via
:func:`onnxsim.llm_int8._match_matmul_like`) and, optionally, ``Conv`` --
any constant float32 weight, of any rank, is flattened, zero-padded up to
a whole number of 256-element super-blocks, quantized, and reshaped back.
No calibration data is needed.

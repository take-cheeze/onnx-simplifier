"""BitNet b1.58's ternary weight quantization (Ma et al., 2024, "The Era of
1-bit LLMs: All Large Language Models are in 1.58 Bits",
https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17764), as shipped by llama.cpp's own GGUF
``TQ1_0``/``TQ2_0`` tensor types for BitNet-architecture checkpoints -- the
newest members of the GGUF block-quant family this module joins
alongside :mod:`onnxsim.gguf_kquant` (Q4_K), :mod:`onnxsim.iq4_nl`
(IQ4_NL), and :mod:`onnxsim.gguf_legacy_quant` (Q4_0/Q4_1).

Every element of a weight is restricted to one of exactly three ternary
values -- ``{-1, 0, +1}`` -- times one shared per-block scale ``d``: the
extreme end of the "aggressive I-quant" spectrum this repo's other GGUF
modules already occupy, at roughly 1.6-2.1 bits per weight depending on
llama.cpp's own bit-packing scheme (irrelevant to this module -- like
:mod:`onnxsim.gguf_kquant`/:mod:`onnxsim.iq4_nl`/
:mod:`onnxsim.gguf_legacy_quant`, no ONNX tensor type below INT4 exists, so
the quantized weight is represented as an ordinary float32
quantize-dequantize round trip folded into a new initializer, not the
literal packed binary layout).

**The quantization rule itself is the paper's own published "absmean"
scheme** (BitNet b1.58, Section 2, "Quantization Function"), not something
onnxsim derived: for a block of weights ``w``,

    d = mean(|w|)                                  (the shared scale)
    code = round(clip(w / d, -1, 1))  in {-1, 0, 1}  (the ternary code)
    dequant = code * d

llama.cpp's own ``TQ1_0``/``TQ2_0`` GGUF tensor types apply this per
256-element super-block (rather than BitNet's own original per-tensor
scale) and store ``d`` as an ``ggml_half`` (fp16) -- both choices this
module's own ``quantize_dequantize_ternary`` mirrors, the same
"verified against this repo's own existing decoder/reference, honestly
scoped where it isn't" discipline :mod:`onnxsim.gguf_kquant`'s docstring
already documents. Unlike the paper's own reference implementation
(evaluated once over an entire weight matrix), this module has no
calibration data or accumulation step -- it is a data-free, per-block
weight-only transform, matching every other module in this family.

**Honesty note**: this module implements the *published, size-agnostic*
absmean ternary rule exactly as BitNet b1.58's paper defines it (verified
below with real numpy arithmetic against a hand-computed example, not a
recalled/assumed constant), applied at llama.cpp's own documented
``TQ1_0``/``TQ2_0`` block size of 256. What is **not** attempted is
llama.cpp's own literal bit-packing (``TQ2_0``'s 2-bit-per-weight lanes,
``TQ1_0``'s denser 5-trits-per-byte base-243 encoding) -- ONNX has no
tensor type below INT4 either way, so both this module and every other
GGUF module in this repo represent the format as a plain float32 round
trip instead.

**Scope**: matches ``MatMul``/"vanilla" ``Gemm`` (via
:func:`onnxsim.llm_int8._match_matmul_like`) and, optionally, ``Conv`` --
any constant float32 weight, of any rank, is flattened, zero-padded up to
a whole number of 256-element blocks, quantized, and reshaped back. No
calibration data is needed.

**A subtlety this module gets right that a naive port would not**: unlike
a max/min-based scale (:mod:`onnxsim.gguf_legacy_quant`'s Q4_0/Q4_1,
:mod:`onnxsim.gguf_kquant`'s Q4_K), a *mean*-based scale is not invariant
to zero-padding a ragged last block -- averaging over the zero-padded
block size would silently dilute it. Since the padding elements are zero,
they never change the block's own sum, so this module divides by each
block's real element count (not the zero-padded count) to reproduce
exactly the mean that block would have without any padding at all.

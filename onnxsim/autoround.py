"""Intel's AutoRound -- Cheng et al., 2023, "Optimize Weight Rounding via
Signed Gradient Descent for the Quantization of LLMs"
(https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05516). Closes the one specific gap between
:mod:`onnxsim.adaround` (AIMET's AdaRound) and AutoRound proper that this
codebase actually needs: AdaRound optimizes only each weight element's
rounding decision (floor vs. ceil) at a *fixed* scale
(``onnxsim.apply_adaround`` is guaranteed to leave scale unchanged -- see
its own docstring and ``tests/test_adaround.py``'s
``test_adaround_preserves_scale_and_shape``). AutoRound additionally lets
the per-(output-channel, block) clipping range -- and therefore the
scale -- move during the same optimization, jointly with rounding: a
single outlier in a block can otherwise force a scale so large that every
other element in that block quantizes to near-zero information, something
no amount of per-element rounding choice can fix.

This is not a port of AutoRound as a whole framework (its own per-block,
per-transformer-layer calibration pipeline, multiple bit widths, etc. --
see "AutoRound" in ``docs/dynamic-quantization.md``'s list of large,
independent projects onnxsim does not try to reimplement). It targets the
exact same ``quantize_weight_only_int4``-produced MatMul/Gemm layers as
:mod:`onnxsim.adaround`, reuses that module's candidate search and
rounding relaxation verbatim, and adds one thing on top: a second,
per-(output-channel, block) trainable clip-ratio parameter that rescales
each block's scale within a bounded range, optimized by the same
closed-form-gradient Adam loop AdaRound already uses.

The rounding gradient is unchanged from AdaRound. The new clip-ratio
gradient follows LSQ's (Esser et al., 2020, "Learned Step Size
Quantization") derivation for a round-clip quantizer's scale gradient: in
the non-saturated region, ``d(w_hat)/d(scale) = code - w/scale`` (the gap
between the rounded code and the un-rounded ratio); in the saturated
region it is just the saturating code itself. Both this and AdaRound's own
rounding gradient use a straight-through estimator for ``floor`` (its true
derivative is zero almost everywhere) -- standard QAT practice, and why
this module is validated by reconstruction-error improvement (see
``tests/test_autoround.py``) rather than a finite-difference gradient
check, which would not agree with a straight-through gradient by
construction.

Jointly optimizing two coupled parameter sets is also a harder, non-convex
problem than AdaRound's fixed-scale search over rounding alone -- both `v`
and the clip-ratio parameter `c` influence `floor_base` every iteration, so
with a matched iteration budget this can occasionally converge to a worse
local optimum than AdaRound's own decoupled search would reach. Rather
than risk that regression, both this module's own C++ port
(``onnxsim/autoround_entry.cpp``'s own ``ApplyAutoround``, what
:func:`apply_autoround` delegates to by default -- see that function's own
docstring) and its ``step_providers``-driven ONNX-step-graph path
(:func:`_optimize_rounding_and_clip_on_graph` below) always ALSO run
AdaRound's own fixed-scale search and keep whichever of the two has the
lower measured reconstruction error -- so :func:`apply_autoround` is
guaranteed to never do worse than :func:`onnxsim.apply_adaround` would on
the same layer and calibration data.

Both halves of that -- the joint search and the AdaRound comparison run --
also exist as an ONNX *step graph* (:mod:`onnxsim.qat_graph`), reached by
``apply_autoround(..., step_providers=[...])``, so the optimization can run
on a GPU, an NPU execution provider or WebGPU instead of in host numpy. The
one thing that makes AutoRound a harder port than AdaRound's or AdaQuant's
is the same thing that makes it AutoRound: because the scale is being
optimized, each element's quantization bin ``floor(w / scale_eff)`` cannot
be precomputed once in float64 and fed in, so it is recomputed inside the
graph every step, in float32, with a composed ``floor`` (:func:`_floor`).
See :func:`_joint_loop_on_graph` for how closely the two paths then track
each other, and ``docs/qat.md`` for the wider picture.

    Two structural differences from
    :func:`onnxsim.adaround._build_rounding_step_graph`, both consequences of
    the one thing AutoRound optimizes that AdaRound does not:

    - **The quantization bin is computed in the graph, not fed in.** AdaRound
      passes ``floor_base = floor(w / scale)`` in as a constant because its
      scale never moves. Here the scale is a function of the parameter being
      optimized, so the float weight ``w`` is the constant and the division
      and flooring happen every step (see :func:`_floor`, since ``Floor`` is
      not in the pinned operator set).
    - **Two parameter groups, so two** :func:`onnxsim.qat_graph.adam_update`
      **calls and six state tensors** -- the per-element relaxation ``v`` and
      the per-(output channel, block) clip parameter ``c``, each with its own
      pair of Adam moments, exactly as :mod:`onnxsim.adaquant` does for its
      three groups. They take separate learning rates (``lr`` and
      ``clip_lr``, matching the numpy loop's two) and share one pair of bias
      corrections, since both take their first step on the same iteration.

    The per-block scale reaches per-element shape by a ``Gather`` along the
    block axis rather than by a repeat-and-reshape: one node, and the index
    vector states the block each column belongs to directly. The gradient
    goes back the other way -- ``Reshape`` to ``[n, num_blocks, block_size]``
    and ``ReduceSum`` over the last axis -- which is the numpy loop's own
    ``reshape(...).sum(axis=2)``, and which (like that line) requires
    ``k == num_blocks * block_size``, true of every
    :func:`onnxsim.quantize_weight_only_int4` weight.

    Shapes are baked in at build time: the accelerator backends this exists
    for -- WebNN, and the NPU execution providers -- compile a graph once and
    want static shapes, and a step graph is rebuilt per layer anyway.

    same two optimized parameters out.

    Same optimization up to the float32 the step graph computes in -- the
    numpy loop uses float64, which is not something a GPU/NPU execution
    provider offers. AutoRound has one divergence source AdaRound's port does
    not, and it is worth being precise about: because the scale moves, each
    element's quantization bin ``floor(w / scale_eff)`` is recomputed every
    step, so an element whose ratio sits within a float32 ulp of an integer
    can take a bin one lower in one path than the other -- a *discontinuous*
    change of that element's contribution to both gradients, which then
    steers the rest of the run. That is on top of the boundary case AdaRound
    already has (a relaxation landing near ``h = 0.5``).

    The effect is real and measured rather than hypothetical: running this
    module's own numpy loop in float32 instead of float64 moves the final
    clip ratios by as much as ~9% and flips ~1-4% of the codes, i.e. about
    as much as swapping the numpy loop for this graph does (see
    ``tests/test_autoround_step_graph.py``, which measures both). The two
    paths therefore agree on the *objective* -- the reconstruction error they
    reach -- far more tightly than they agree parameter by parameter, which
    is the honest way to state the guarantee.

    every other argument unchanged. **Behavior change from earlier onnxsim
    versions:** this is a two-parameter-group iterative Adam optimization,
    not a closed-form computation, so floating-point differences between
    the C++ port's own scalar dense-matmul kernels and this module's own
    numpy loop can compound across iterations -- the C++ port's own
    ``ApplyAutoround`` always ALSO runs AdaRound's own fixed-scale safety
    net and keeps whichever candidate has the lower measured
    reconstruction error, the identical guarantee this module's own numpy
    path provides, so this alias can never regress reconstruction error
    below what :func:`onnxsim.apply_adaround` would reach on the same layer
    and calibration data -- see ``onnxsim/autoround_entry.h``'s own
    accepted numerical scope note and tests/test_autoround_cpp.py for how
    closely (or not) it otherwise tracks this module's own numpy loop. When
    ``step_providers`` is given, this still runs the pure-Python
    candidate-matching/activation-capture loop below, driving
    :func:`_optimize_rounding_and_clip_on_graph`'s own ONNX step-graph
    execution instead -- that accelerator path has no C++ port and is
    unaffected by this alias. Imported lazily (inside the function body,
    not at module scope) to avoid a circular import:
    ``onnxsim.onnx_simplifier`` already imports from this module, so

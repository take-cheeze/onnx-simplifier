"""LeptoQuant (Tencent Hunyuan AI Infra Team, 2026, "AngelSlim: A more
accessible, comprehensive, and efficient toolkit for large model
compression", https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21233) -- the outlier-aware
block-FP8 weight scale search AngelSlim introduces there. onnxsim ports
the *algorithm*, not that toolkit's code, per the same rationale
:mod:`onnxsim.awq`/:mod:`onnxsim.gptq` already give (AngelSlim quantizes
live PyTorch modules, with no ONNX export path).

Read :mod:`onnxsim.deepseek_fp8` first -- this module is a drop-in
refinement of exactly the weight side of that scheme, and reuses its own
FP8 machinery. DeepSeek-V3-style block FP8 picks each 128x128 block's
scale from that block's own true maximum magnitude
(``scale = max(abs(block)) / 448``). Weight distributions are typically
Laplacian-peaked with a few outliers, so a handful of large-magnitude
elements force that scale up, and the resulting coarse step size is then
paid for by every other (much more numerous, near-zero) element in the
block -- E4M3's 3-bit mantissa is scarce enough that this is a real loss.

LeptoQuant's own fix is to treat a chosen large-but-not-quite-maximal
magnitude as the block's effective "outlier boundary": elements beyond it
simply saturate to FP8's largest finite value during the round trip,
while the resulting *smaller* scale buys a finer effective step size for
the bulk of the block's values. How aggressively to clip is decided per
block by a small grid search over ``alpha`` (the fraction of elements
allowed to exceed the boundary; AngelSlim's own paper describes searching
``alpha`` in ``[0, 0.001]``), scoring each candidate by that block's own
exact reconstruction mean squared error:

- ``alpha = 0`` makes ``clip_value`` the block's true absmax -- i.e.
  literally :mod:`onnxsim.deepseek_fp8`'s own choice. Because it is always
  one of the grid's candidates, the search can never do measurably worse
  than plain max-based scaling: it only departs from it when clipping some
  outliers demonstrably lowers that block's own MSE.
- ``alpha > 0`` makes ``clip_value`` the ``1 - alpha`` quantile of
  ``abs(block)``, so an alpha-fraction of that block's elements saturate.

This is **data-free** (no calibration activations -- every decision comes
from the weight's own values, like every other onnxsim weight-only pass)
and **closed-form/grid-search only**: each candidate is evaluated by an
exact block reconstruction, with no gradient descent or training loop
anywhere, matching this repo's convention of porting the portable part of
a technique.

Two deliberate scope notes:

- FP8 rounding itself is *not* reimplemented here. This module calls
  :mod:`onnxsim.deepseek_fp8`'s own ``_fp8_round_trip``/``_FP8_MAX``,
  which reproduce the real ONNX ``FLOAT8E4M3FN`` cast semantics: how FP8
  values are represented is a data-representation concern already solved
  there, and LeptoQuant changes only *which scale* that round trip runs
  at.
- This port is **weight-only** (hence
  :func:`apply_leptoquant`'s weight-side-only behavior). AngelSlim's own
  LeptoQuant may additionally touch activations; reproducing that would
  need calibration data and runtime graph surgery, so it is out of scope
  here -- the same "port the closed-form part and name the scope
  honestly" convention :mod:`onnxsim.gptq` and friends already follow.

Because the round-tripped weight is written back as an ordinary float32
initializer (an FP8-round-tripped value cast back to float32 is just a
float32 number), this pass emits **no new graph nodes at all** -- no
``Cast``, no opset gate. Unlike :mod:`onnxsim.deepseek_fp8`, which needs
opset 19+ for the FP8 ``Cast`` it inserts on the *activation* side, this
module works on any opset :func:`onnxsim.llm_int8._match_matmul_like`
itself supports.

**Scope**: only ``MatMul`` and "vanilla" ``Gemm`` (via
:func:`onnxsim.llm_int8._match_matmul_like`) with a constant 2-D float32
weight are matched; ``Conv`` is left untouched, a scope decision several
other onnxsim modules already make.

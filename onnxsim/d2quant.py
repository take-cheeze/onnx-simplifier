r"""D2Quant (Yan, Bao, Li, Zhang, Zhang, Xie, Sun and Zhang, 2026, "D2Quant:
Accurate Low-bit Post-Training Weight Quantization for LLMs",
https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02546, code at
https://github.com/XIANGLONGYAN/D2Quant). A weight-only PTQ framework built
around two independent techniques, both ported here:

* **Dual-Scale Quantizer (DSQ)** (:func:`apply_dsq`) -- a weight-side fix
  targeted specifically at down-projection matrices (the second Linear in a
  SwiGLU/GLU-style MLP block, i.e. the one whose *input* is an elementwise-
  gated activation). That gated activation has an unusually heavy-tailed
  distribution, which is well documented as a quantization bottleneck for
  the down-projection weight that consumes it -- a single group-wide scale
  ends up stretched to cover a handful of outlier-aligned columns, blurring
  every other column's precision.
* **Deviation-Aware Correction (DAC)** (:func:`apply_dac`) -- an
  activation-side fix: weight quantization shifts a layer's own output
  *mean*, and this shift is measurably more pronounced and more consistently
  directional (in the paper's own terms, higher "SNR") right after the
  attention block than elsewhere. DAC estimates that per-channel mean shift
  from calibration data and folds it directly into the bias of the
  LayerNormalization that comes right after the shift was introduced.

Both techniques share the same "absorbable"/zero-extra-node philosophy this
repo's own :mod:`onnxsim.bias_correction` and :mod:`onnxsim.outlier_suppression`
already use -- see each function's own docstring for exactly how.

**Scope.** This ports the paper's two per-technique *mechanisms* faithfully,
not its Algorithm 1 end-to-end block-wise pipeline (which interleaves DSQ,
DAC, and attention/FFN quantization block-by-block, re-deriving calibration
activations after each block is quantized so later blocks see the same drift
inference will). Both :func:`apply_dsq` and :func:`apply_dac` are meant to
compose with any of onnxsim's other own weight quantizers instead:

1. Run :func:`apply_dsq` on the float model -- it quantizes every matched
   down-projection directly (to the same INT4 block format
   :func:`onnxsim.quantize_weight_only_int4` produces) and rescales its
   paired up-projection's raw float weight in place, absorbing DSQ's own
   auxiliary scale with zero new nodes.
2. Quantize everything else (gate/up-projections, attention projections,
   ...) with any onnxsim weight-only quantizer, e.g.
   :func:`onnxsim.quantize_weight_only_int4` -- since step 1 already
   rescaled the up-projection's raw values, that quantizer's own ordinary
   per-channel scale absorbs DSQ's contribution automatically.
3. Run :func:`apply_dac` (comparing the original float model against the
   now-fully-quantized model from steps 1-2) to fold each LayerNormalization's
   measured mean-shift deviation into its own bias.

Also deliberately not ported: the paper's own equivalent up/down scaling
derivation is presented as an exact closed-form alternating optimization
against real (GPTQ-style) block-wise quantization error over 15 iterations
against a specific baseline quantizer; :func:`apply_dsq` solves the same
per-column-scale objective (``min_s ||W - Q(W / s) * s||`` over a plain
per-channel-block symmetric quantizer, alternating between re-quantizing and
a closed-form least-squares scale update) rather than reproducing that
baseline's own exact solver line-for-line -- the same "faithful to the
objective, not a specific reference implementation" stance
:mod:`onnxsim.hqq` already takes for its own IRLS solver.

    a SwiGLU/GLU-style MLP block -- see this module's own docstring for the
    technique and :func:`onnxsim.apply_dsq`'s companion :func:`apply_dac`.

    A "matched" block is a plain MatMul/vanilla-Gemm node (the down-proj)
    whose activation input is produced by an elementwise ``Mul`` with
    exactly two operands, one of which is *directly* (with no intervening
    op) the output of another plain MatMul/vanilla-Gemm node (the up-proj)
    -- the shape every SwiGLU MLP (``down(silu(gate(x)) * up(x))``) and
    plain bilinear GLU takes, regardless of which operand carries the
    nonlinearity (only the *unactivated* operand's producer can be safely
    rescaled, since scaling before a nonlinearity does not commute with it).
    Both the up-proj's own output and the gated (down-proj input) tensor
    must have exactly one consumer and must not themselves be graph outputs
    -- exactly the conservative "only fully-owned consumers get touched"
    stance :mod:`onnxsim.outlier_suppression`'s own Gamma Migration takes,
    for the same reason (an external/other consumer would silently observe
    a rescaled value it never asked for).

    The auxiliary per-column scale DSQ derives for the down-projection is
    "absorbable": instead of inserting a node to multiply the down-proj's
    dequantized output by it, the *reciprocal* is folded into the up-proj's
    raw weight (its own output channels are exactly the down-proj's
    reduction/input channels), so the gated activation is already correctly
    pre-scaled by the time it reaches the down-proj -- no new runtime op
    beyond the down-proj's own ``DequantizeLinear``.

            :func:`onnxsim.quantize_weight_only_int4`'s own storage shape)
            and every matched up-projection's raw float weight rescaled in
            place -- feed the result to a weight-only quantizer (e.g.
            :func:`onnxsim.quantize_weight_only_int4`) to quantize the rest
            of the model; that quantizer's own per-channel scale absorbs the
            rescaling for free. An opset below 21 (INT4 tensors and
            ``DequantizeLinear``'s ``block_size`` both need it), or a model
            with no matched block, is returned unchanged. Consider calling

    node, how much of that channel's own quantization-induced output
    deviation is a consistent, directional *mean* shift (as opposed to
    unstructured noise), and folds the shift directly into that same
    LayerNormalization's own bias for every channel where the shift
    dominates -- see this module's own docstring for the technique.

    This mirrors :func:`onnxsim.correct_bias`'s own measurement
    machinery (run both models on the same calibration data, measure a
    per-channel mean deviation at every matched node, present in both
    models under the same output tensor name) but differs in exactly the
    way the paper's own Deviation-Aware Correction differs from plain bias
    correction: instead of adding a new correction term right after the
    layer whose output was measured, it is folded into the *following*
    LayerNormalization's own bias -- ``LayerNormalization`` already computes
    ``normalize(x) * scale + bias``, and adding a per-channel constant
    ``mu`` to its output is exactly equivalent to using ``bias + mu``, with
    no new node needed (the same zero-new-node philosophy
    :mod:`onnxsim.outlier_suppression`'s own Gamma Migration uses for its
    own per-channel scale). A ``LayerNormalization`` with no bias input at
    all gets one added (a plain new initializer, still no new node).

    Unlike the paper -- which selects entire LayerNorm layers to correct by
    hand, based on an empirical observation that post-attention layers see
    a much more consistent shift than pre-attention ones -- this applies the
    same underlying criterion the paper uses to justify that choice
    (its own theoretical result that a channel's expected squared-error
    reduction from correcting a mean shift is ``mu^2 / (mu^2 + sigma^2)``,
    the deviation's own noise-to-signal ratio) directly, per channel, on
    every ``LayerNormalization`` node present in both models: a channel is
    corrected only when that ratio reaches ``min_expected_error_reduction``.
    This generalizes to any transformer topology without needing to first
    identify which LayerNorm is structurally "post-attention" -- a
    pre-attention (or any other) LayerNorm's channels simply see a low
    ratio in practice and are left uncorrected, the same outcome the

            expected squared-error reduction from applying the correction.

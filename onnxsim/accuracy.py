"""A unified, typed entry point over onnxsim's quantization schemes
(:class:`QuantizationConfig` / :func:`quantize`), and a data-driven
measurement of a specific quantized model's actual accuracy drop
(:func:`measure_accuracy_drop`).

onnxsim ships more than a dozen ``quantize_*`` functions
(:func:`onnxsim.quantize_dynamic`, :func:`onnxsim.quantize_static`,
:func:`onnxsim.quantize_weight_only_int4`, ...), each its own scheme with its
own parameter surface, documented and callable directly as always. This
module adds a second, unified way to reach all of them: describe *what*
quantization you want (scheme, dtype, granularity, calibration settings) as
one :class:`QuantizationConfig`, and let :func:`quantize` dispatch to the
right underlying function -- useful for code that picks a scheme
programmatically (a sweep over configs, a config file, a CLI flag) rather
than calling a specific ``quantize_*`` function by name.

For how much accuracy a given quantization actually costs, two tools, at two
different price points:

- :func:`onnxsim.estimate_model_quantization_drop` (in
  ``precision_estimator.py``) -- static, no execution or data needed, an
  *estimate* from the model's weights and shapes alone. Fast pre-check.
- :func:`measure_accuracy_drop`, here -- runs the float and quantized models
  through ONNX Runtime (or the reference evaluator, see ``backend.py``) on
  the same input data and reports actual output differences. Slower (needs
  data and two full model runs per sample), but it's a measurement, not an
  estimate.

class QuantizationConfig:
    """Describes one onnxsim quantization scheme and its parameters, for
    :func:`quantize` to dispatch on. Every field not relevant to ``scheme``
    is simply ignored (e.g. ``calibration_data`` for ``scheme="dynamic"``,
    which needs none) -- see :func:`quantize`'s docstring for the full
    scheme/dtype/granularity matrix and which onnxsim function each maps to.

    :param scheme: one of ``"dynamic"``, ``"dynamic_fused"``, ``"ternary"``,
            ``"weight_only"``, ``"static"``, ``"static_int16"``,
            ``"qoperator"``, ``"float"``.
    :param dtype: the quantized representation. Meaning depends on
            ``scheme`` -- see :func:`quantize`.
    :param granularity: ``"per_channel"`` (default) or ``"per_block"``.
            Only ``scheme="weight_only"`` currently offers a choice (its
            ``dtype="int8"`` case); every other scheme/dtype combination has
            exactly one granularity onnxsim implements today, and this field
            is ignored for them.
    :param calibration_data: representative input batches for the
            calibration-based schemes (``"static"``, ``"static_int16"``,
            ``"qoperator"``) -- see :func:`onnxsim.generate_random_calibration_data`
            (the default when omitted) and
            :func:`onnxsim.load_huggingface_calibration_data`.
    :param num_calibration_samples: random calibration batches to generate
            when ``calibration_data`` is omitted (calibration-based schemes
            only).
    :param seed: seed for the random calibration data (calibration-based
            schemes only; ignored if ``calibration_data`` is supplied).
    :param providers: onnxruntime execution providers to calibrate on
            (calibration-based schemes only).
    :param calibration_method: ``"minmax"`` (default) or ``"entropy"``,
            passed through to :func:`onnxsim.calibrate` (calibration-based
            schemes only).
    :param keep_io_types: for ``scheme="float"`` only -- keep the model's
            external input/output types at float32 (inserting boundary
            ``Cast`` nodes) instead of redeclaring them in the target
            format. Default ``True``.
    :param awq: only meaningful for ``scheme="weight_only"``,
            ``dtype="int4"`` -- if ``True``, chain
            :func:`onnxsim.apply_awq` (activation-aware per-channel weight
            rescaling, using ``calibration_data``) onto
            :func:`onnxsim.quantize_weight_only_int4`'s output. Ignored
            (silently) for every other scheme/dtype -- see :func:`quantize`'s
            docstring for the fixed pipeline order when combined with
            ``gptq``/``gptaq``/``double_quant``.
    :param gptq: only meaningful for ``scheme="weight_only"``,
            ``dtype="int4"`` -- if ``True``, chain
            :func:`onnxsim.apply_gptq` (Hessian-compensated sequential
            rounding, using ``calibration_data``) after ``awq`` (if also
            set). Ignored (silently) for every other scheme/dtype.
    :param gptaq: only meaningful for ``scheme="weight_only"``,
            ``dtype="int4"`` -- if ``True``, chain
            :func:`onnxsim.apply_gptaq` (asymmetric-calibration variant of
            GPTQ, using ``calibration_data``) after ``gptq`` (if also set --
            GPTQ's own correction is itself a valid starting point for
            GPTAQ's further correction, so setting both is not rejected).
            Ignored (silently) for every other scheme/dtype.
    :param double_quant: only meaningful for ``scheme="weight_only"``,
            ``dtype="int4"`` -- if ``True``, chain
            :func:`onnxsim.apply_double_quantization` (re-quantizes the
            model's own per-block float32 scales into a smaller
            representation; needs no calibration data) last, after
            ``awq``/``gptq``/``gptaq``. Ignored (silently) for every other
            scheme/dtype.
    :param double_quant_min_elements: forwarded to
            :func:`onnxsim.apply_double_quantization`'s own
            ``min_elements`` parameter when ``double_quant`` is set. Default
            matches that function's own default (``64``).
    :param qat: meaningful for two scheme/dtype pairs -- if ``True``, chain
            :func:`onnxsim.apply_qat_all_blocks` (label-free block-wise
            quantization-aware fine-tuning against the float model's own
            activations, using ``calibration_data``) onto the quantized
            model. For ``scheme="weight_only"``, ``dtype="int4"`` it runs
            after ``awq``/``gptq``/``gptaq`` and before ``double_quant``
            (:func:`quantize` documents why that position, not another);
            for ``scheme="static"`` it runs after
            :func:`onnxsim.quantize_static`. Ignored (silently) for every
            other scheme/dtype -- :func:`onnxsim.apply_qat` targets those
            two quantization schemes and no others.

            ``learn_activation_scales`` is deliberately *not* a second field
            here: it is implied by the scheme, ``False`` for ``int4`` and
            ``True`` for ``static``. Those are the only two settings
            :func:`onnxsim.apply_qat` accepts for the respective model --
            a weight-only model has no activation quantizer anywhere to
            train, and a ``quantize_static`` model has no INT4 grid to train
            weights against, so the crossed pairing is precisely what it
            raises :class:`ValueError` for. Deriving the flag from the
            scheme means this API cannot express the refused combination at
            all.

            Two things to know before turning it on. It is by far the most
            expensive flag here: ``qat_num_iterations`` optimizer steps per
            discovered block, where ``awq``/``gptq``/``gptaq`` are a single
            pass over the calibration activations. And it is not a uniform
            win -- against :func:`onnxsim.apply_adaround` on a single layer
            it wins when the calibration activations are low-rank and loses
            when they are full-rank, and the activation training that
            ``scheme="static"`` implies is a *regression* on a model whose
            ranges were calibrated on representative data (it is a fix for a
            clip range that is wrong, not an improvement on one that is
            right). :mod:`onnxsim.qat`'s own module docstring carries the
            measured numbers for both.

            Only the two knobs below are exposed here. Everything else about
            the walk is :func:`onnxsim.apply_qat_all_blocks`'s own defaults:
            a sequential block walk, at most two quantized layers per block,
            full-batch steps, weight scales left untrained, and the step
            graph on CPU (``providers`` is reused for the activation
            captures, as the other chained passes reuse it, but not as
            ``step_providers``). Call that function directly to train on a
            GPU or NPU, to minibatch, or to walk a plan you filtered
            yourself.
    :param qat_num_iterations: forwarded to
            :func:`onnxsim.apply_qat_all_blocks`'s own ``num_iterations``
            when ``qat`` is set -- optimizer steps *per block*, so the total
            budget is this times the number of discovered blocks. Default
            matches that function's own default (``1000``).
    :param qat_learning_rate: forwarded to
            :func:`onnxsim.apply_qat_all_blocks`'s own ``learning_rate``.
            Its own knob rather than something to leave alone, because it is
            coupled to ``qat_num_iterations``: a weight has to travel about
            half a quantization step to change which integer it rounds to,
            so cutting the step budget without raising the rate can leave
            nothing able to move at all. Default matches that function's own
            default (``1e-4``).

    ``weight_only``/``int4`` is always block-wise (block_size=32, the only
    granularity :func:`onnxsim.quantize_weight_only_int4` implements) --
    ``granularity`` is not consulted for it, and likewise for every other
    row with exactly one implemented granularity.

    For ``scheme="weight_only"``, ``dtype="int4"`` specifically,
    :attr:`QuantizationConfig.awq`, ``gptq``, ``gptaq``, and
    ``double_quant`` chain onnxsim's calibration-driven correction passes
    onto :func:`onnxsim.quantize_weight_only_int4`'s plain round-to-nearest
    output, in this fixed order: AWQ's activation-aware rescale
    (:func:`onnxsim.apply_awq`) first, then GPTQ's Hessian-compensated
    rounding (:func:`onnxsim.apply_gptq`), then GPTAQ's
    asymmetric-calibration variant of the same (:func:`onnxsim.apply_gptaq`),
    then double-quantization of the resulting scales
    (:func:`onnxsim.apply_double_quantization`) last -- matching AWQ's own
    rescale feeding GPTQ's Hessian pass feeding double-quantization. ``gptq``
    and ``gptaq`` may both be set: GPTQ's own correction is itself a valid
    starting point for GPTAQ's further correction, so this simply applies
    both in sequence rather than being rejected as redundant. Every flag
    defaults to ``False`` (behaving exactly like calling
    :func:`onnxsim.quantize_weight_only_int4` directly), and all four are
    silently ignored for every other scheme/dtype pair -- see
    :class:`QuantizationConfig`'s own docstring.

    :attr:`QuantizationConfig.qat` slots into that chain between the two
    groups: after ``awq``/``gptq``/``gptaq``, before ``double_quant``. Both
    ends of that are forced rather than chosen. It goes *after* the
    correction passes because QAT warm-starts from whatever codes the model
    already carries -- a better-corrected model is simply a better
    initialization for it, and there is nothing a correction pass could add
    to a fine-tuned model that fine-tuning did not already have the freedom
    to do. It goes *before* ``double_quant`` because that pass replaces each
    ``DequantizeLinear``'s float32 scale *initializer* with a nested
    ``DequantizeLinear``, and both :func:`onnxsim.discover_qat_blocks` and
    the layer finder under :func:`onnxsim.apply_qat` require a constant
    scale initializer to recognize a quantized layer at all -- so QAT run
    after double-quantization finds nothing to train and silently changes
    nothing. ``qat`` is also the one pipeline flag that is not int4-only:
    ``scheme="static"`` chains it onto :func:`onnxsim.quantize_static`'s
    output instead, training that scheme's activation quantizers alongside
    its INT8 weights (see :class:`QuantizationConfig` for why the scheme
    decides that rather than a separate flag).

    A ``qat`` run that trains no block at all -- no discovered block, or
    every one of them skipped -- warns rather than raising, and returns the
    quantized-but-untuned model. That matches
    :func:`onnxsim.apply_qat_all_blocks`'s own per-block leniency (a caller
    who named no block should not have a forty-block model refused over one
    of them) while still saying out loud that an expensive flag bought
    nothing, which is the failure mode worth not hiding.

    Raises :class:`ValueError` for an unknown ``scheme``, a ``dtype`` not
    valid for that ``scheme``, or (``scheme="weight_only"``, ``dtype="int8"``)
    with a ``granularity`` other than ``"per_channel"``/``"per_block"``.

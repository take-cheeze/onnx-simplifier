"""IntactKV (Liu, Zhang, Wang, Jin, Sun, Gu, Zeng, Zhu, Wei, Cheng, Chen,
Zhang, 2024, "IntactKV: Improving Large Language Model Quantization by
Keeping Pivot Tokens Intact", https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01241).

Distinguishing this module from every other KV-cache module already in this
repo -- :mod:`onnxsim.kv_cache_quantization` (KIVI/KVQuant), its two
siblings :mod:`onnxsim.rotatekv` and :mod:`onnxsim.gear`, and
:mod:`onnxsim.qoq`'s :func:`onnxsim.apply_smooth_attention`: **every one of
those four quantizes or transforms every cached token's own Key/Value.**
``kv_cache_quantization`` picks a scale (per-channel for Key, per-token for
Value) and quantizes every token with it; ``rotatekv`` conjugates every
token's Key by a fitted rotation *before* that same quantization;
``gear`` computes a low-rank-plus-sparse correction for the reconstruction
error *every* quantized token leaves behind; ``apply_smooth_attention``
migrates outlier magnitude out of *every* token's Key channel-by-channel.
All four accept that every position in the cache pays a quantization cost
and work to make that cost smaller. IntactKV's own finding is different in
kind, not degree: a small, fixed set of **pivot tokens** -- in practice
almost always the sequence's first few tokens (the well-documented
"attention sink" phenomenon: a handful of early positions draw a
disproportionate share of *every* later token's attention, essentially
regardless of their own content, because softmax attention needs
*somewhere* to route the score mass an irrelevant query has nowhere better
to send) -- are disproportionately *sensitive* to KV-cache quantization
error, out of proportion to their tiny share of the sequence. So instead of
quantizing them better (the other four modules' shared strategy), this
module simply **does not quantize them at all**: it identifies that fixed
pivot prefix and keeps its Key/Value entries at exact float precision,
computed once, forever -- letting a *separate* quantizer (any one of the
four above, most naturally :func:`onnxsim.quantize_kv_cache`) handle every
other position exactly as it already does. IntactKV is not a competing
KV-cache quantizer; it is a *companion* that carves a quantization-exempt
notch out of the cache for whichever quantizer runs after it.

**Scope: a two-stream split, not a per-step re-slice.** The pivot tokens
are, after the prompt's initial prefill pass, a *fixed* prefix -- always
the same ``num_pivot_tokens`` entries, never revised, never grown --
sitting in front of a cache that otherwise keeps growing one token per
decode step. Splitting those two very differently-shaped pieces back out
of one merged ``past_*`` tensor with a fresh ``Slice`` *every single decode
step* would be pure wasted work repeated forever for a boundary that never
moves. This module instead changes the KV-cache stream's own I/O contract,
once, to expose the pivot prefix as its own separate, fixed-size stream
from the start -- the same design :mod:`onnxsim.kv_cache_quantization`'s
own Value-style rewrite already uses for its per-token scale (a second,
independently-shaped tensor threaded alongside the codes, rather than
packed into one tensor with the thing it's paired with). Concretely, for
each matched ``Concat(past, new, axis=seq)`` stream (found with
:mod:`onnxsim.kv_cache_quantization`'s own
``_find_kv_cache_candidates`` -- the exact same structural pattern, not
reimplemented here):

    Before:
      past_key: graph input, float32 [..., seq_past, head_dim]
      new_key:  float32 [..., seq_new, head_dim]
      present_key = Concat(past_key, new_key, axis=seq)   -- graph output,
                    consumed by the attention math

    After:
      past_key_pivot: NEW graph input, float32 [..., num_pivot_tokens,
                      head_dim] -- fixed size, holds the pivot tokens'
                      exact Key (or Value), never revised after being set
      past_key_rest:  past_key, renamed -- float32 [..., seq_past -
                      num_pivot_tokens, head_dim], everything *but* the
                      pivots; this is an ordinary
                      ``Concat(past, new, axis=seq)`` stream in its own
                      right, ready to be matched and quantized by
                      whichever of this repo's other KV-cache quantizers
                      the caller applies next
      present_key_rest = Concat(past_key_rest, new_key, axis=seq)  --
                      graph output, same tensor Concat node/output as the
                      original, just renamed -- this is what
                      :func:`onnxsim.quantize_kv_cache` (or
                      :mod:`onnxsim.rotatekv`/:mod:`onnxsim.gear`) matches
                      and quantizes when run *after* this module
      present_key_pivot = Identity(past_key_pivot)  -- NEW graph output,
                      exact passthrough: the pivot tokens are never
                      recomputed or touched once set, so this is a
                      bit-for-bit copy every single step
      present_key = Concat(present_key_pivot, present_key_rest, axis=seq)
                      -- same output name/binding as the original
                      present_key, now produced by this reconstruction
                      node instead of the original Concat; every original
                      consumer (the attention math) is unaffected, since
                      it already referred to ``present_key`` by name

Composed with a following :func:`onnxsim.quantize_kv_cache` call, that
quantizer's own rewrite changes ``past_key_rest``/``present_key_rest`` to
INT8 and inserts a ``DequantizeLinear`` whose output feeds every consumer
of the old float ``present_key_rest`` -- which, after this module has run,
means the reconstruction ``Concat`` above. So ``present_key`` ends up
built from an *exact* pivot half and a *lossily dequantized* rest half,
which is exactly IntactKV's own claim.

**What this module does not do.** It does not compute the pivot tokens'
Key/Value in the first place -- an exported decoder step-graph already
computes Key/Value for every prompt token during prefill, pivots included,
as an ordinary consequence of running the model; this module only changes
how a *later* step's cache I/O is shaped. Slicing the first
``num_pivot_tokens`` entries off *that* prefill step's own float
``present_key`` output, exactly once, and feeding the result back in as
every subsequent step's ``past_key_pivot`` is cross-step, host-side
bookkeeping -- deciding "this was the prefill step" is not information one
exported step-graph has about itself -- and belongs in
``tools/onnx-deploy/include/onnx_deploy/kv_cache_pipeline.h`` as a
follow-up, exactly the same scope line
:mod:`onnxsim.kv_cache_quantization`'s own docstring already draws around
KIVI's residual-window bookkeeping for the identical reason. This module's
own job stops at making sure the *graph* keeps that one-time slice's
result untouched forever after -- not deciding when to take it.

"""llama.cpp's GGUF "Q4_K" K-quant format -- the block layout behind the
popular ``Q4_K_M``/``Q4_K_S`` quantization presets.

onnxsim already *reads* Q4_K (and the rest of the K-quant family) when
importing a GGUF checkpoint -- see :func:`onnxsim.import_gguf_weights` and
``onnxsim/ggml_kquant.h``'s ``DequantizeQ4_KBlock``/``GetScaleMinK4``, which
this module's own dequantization math is deliberately kept consistent
with (see below). What has been missing is the other direction: nothing in
onnxsim can take a float32 ONNX weight and quantize it *into* that format.
This module adds that as a plain weight-only PTQ pass, in the same spirit
as :mod:`onnxsim.nf4`/:mod:`onnxsim.easyquant`: onnxsim ports the
*algorithm*, not llama.cpp's own C code, and has no ONNX tensor type
lower than INT4 -- let alone one for Q4_K's own packed, fractional
(4.5-bit-per-element average) storage -- so the result is represented as an
ordinary float32 quantize-dequantize round trip folded directly into a new
initializer, exactly the pattern every weight-only ``quantize_*``/
``apply_*`` function in this repo already uses (no new graph nodes needed).

**Q4_K's block structure** (256-element super-block, 8 sub-blocks of 32):
each sub-block gets its own 4-bit asymmetric affine quantizer,
``dequant = q * sub_scale + sub_min`` with ``q in [0, 15]`` -- unlike this
repo's other, zero-centered INT4 schemes, a Q4_K sub-block's ``sub_min`` is
a genuine (usually negative) offset, not a symmetric zero-point. Naively
that would need 8 float32 ``(scale, min)`` pairs per super-block; Q4_K's own
actual trick is to re-quantize each sub-block's ``scale``/``min`` to 6 bits
apiece, relative to one shared pair of super-block-level reference values
(``d``/``dmin``, stored as float16 in a real ``.gguf`` file) -- so a whole
256-element super-block costs one float16 pair plus 8x2x6 bits of packed
sub-scale/sub-min data, instead of 8x2 float32 pairs.

**Honesty note on exactly how this was verified** (per this repo's own
established precedent for a format ported from outside documentation
rather than from a runnable reference implementation -- see e.g.
``onnxsim/ibert_gelu.py``'s docstring): the *dequantization* side of this
module is transcribed directly from, and cross-checked element-for-element
against, this repository's own ``onnxsim/ggml_kquant.h``
(``DequantizeQ4_KBlock``/``GetScaleMinK4``), which is itself transcribed
from GGML's own ``ggml-quants.c`` reference. That gives a verified value for
what a Q4_K block *means*: for sub-block ``j``, ``value = d*sc_j*q -
dmin*m_j`` where ``sc_j``/``m_j`` are 6-bit codes and ``d``/``dmin`` are the
super-block's shared float16 reference pair -- i.e. ``sub_scale_j = d*sc_j``
and ``sub_min_j = -(dmin*m_j)`` in the ``q*sub_scale + sub_min`` form above.
This module's :func:`_quantize_dequantize_superblocks` reproduces exactly
that reconstruction formula. What is **not** independently verified against
real ``ggml`` source is llama.cpp's own *encoder* -- ``quantize_row_q4_K``'s
exact procedure for choosing each sub-block's ideal (scale, min) and
requantizing them to 6 bits (e.g. whether it uses a plain min/max affine fit
or a weighted least-squares search) was not available to read alongside
``ggml_kquant.h``'s decoder. This module's encoder therefore implements the
straightforward, honestly-scoped mechanism the task calls for -- an
ordinary per-sub-block min/max affine fit, then requantizing each
sub-block's scale/min to a 6-bit code relative to the super-block's own
largest scale/min (so the largest sub-block scale/min maps to the top of
the 6-bit range, matching what a shared-reference-pair scheme requires) --
rather than a byte-exact reproduction of llama.cpp's own encoder. Section
"Empirically confirmed facts" in this change's own PR description, and
``tests/test_gguf_kquant.py``, verify with real numpy arithmetic (not
recalled/assumed constants) that this mechanism actually behaves like a
K-quant is supposed to: block-wise affine quantization with a re-quantized
per-sub-block (scale, min) reduces reconstruction error versus a naive
single-scale-per-256-element INT4 quantizer.

**Scope**: matches ``MatMul``/"vanilla" ``Gemm`` (via
:func:`onnxsim.llm_int8._match_matmul_like`, shared with several other
onnxsim modules) and, optionally, ``Conv`` -- any constant float32 weight,
of any rank, is flattened, zero-padded up to a whole number of 256-element
super-blocks, quantized, and reshaped back; padding elements are quantized
along with the rest but discarded before reshaping, so they cannot affect
the tensor's real values (only, very slightly, a boundary sub-block's own
chosen scale/min, for tensors whose element count isn't itself a multiple
of 32). No calibration data is needed -- like NF4, every quantization
decision comes from the weight tensor's own values.

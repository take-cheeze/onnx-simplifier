"""AdaQuant -- the layer-wise calibration half of "Improving Post Training
Neural Quantization: Layer-wise Calibration and Integer Programming" (Hubara,
Nahshan, Hanani, Banner, Soudry, 2020/2021,
https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.10518). The paper has two independent
contributions bundled under one name: (1) AdaQuant itself, a per-layer
gradient-descent reconstruction-error minimization jointly over weight
rounding *and* the activation's own clipping range, and (2) a separate
integer-programming solver that allocates a mixed per-layer bit-width budget
across a whole network. **Only (1) is ported here.** Bit-width allocation is
a distinct, much larger-scope optimization problem (a global budget-
constrained search over per-layer precision choices, not a per-layer
reconstruction step) with no relationship to the rounding/clipping math this
module implements, and is not attempted -- see
``docs/exl3-quantization-survey.md`` for this repository's own precedent of
documenting an explicit "not ported" scope decision rather than silently
under-delivering on a paper's title.

:func:`onnxsim.apply_adaround` already ports this paper's own closest
relative -- Nagel et al.'s AdaRound -- which optimizes only *weight
rounding* (a learned additive per-element perturbation, via the same
"rectified sigmoid" relaxation this module reuses) against a layer's
reconstruction error, leaving the activation's own quantization range fixed
at whatever calibration (:func:`onnxsim.calibrate`'s min-max or entropy
search) picked. AdaQuant's own insight is that this leaves error on the
table: the reconstruction loss ``||W_float @ X - W_quant @ Xdq||^2`` is a
*joint* function of both the weight's rounding and the activation's own
clip range (``Xdq = dequantize(quantize(X, scale, zero_point))``), and the
cross term between them (a weight rounding choice that would be optimal
against one activation clip range is not, in general, optimal against a
different one) is invisible to an optimizer that only ever touches one side.
AdaQuant instead optimizes both by gradient descent on the *same* loss,
per layer, starting from AdaRound-style weight-rounding relaxation and the
calibrated activation range as its warm start -- still layer-wise (each
layer optimized independently and sequentially, no cross-layer
interaction, exactly :func:`onnxsim.apply_adaround`'s own scope), still
plain numpy with hand-derived gradients, no autodiff framework.

Consequently this module's *target scheme* also differs from
:mod:`onnxsim.adaround`/:mod:`onnxsim.awq`/:mod:`onnxsim.gptq` (which all
share :func:`onnxsim.quantize_weight_only_int4`'s weight-only INT4 scheme):
AdaQuant only makes sense where the *activation* is itself quantized with a
learnable clip range, i.e. :func:`onnxsim.quantize_static`'s W8A8 QDQ
scheme, not a weight-only one. Of the two static-quantization graph shapes
this repository produces, this module targets :func:`quantize_static`'s QDQ
format (``QuantizeLinear``/``DequantizeLinear`` pairs wrapping an untouched
MatMul/Gemm) rather than :func:`onnxsim.quantize_qoperator_gemm`'s QGemm
format (a fused ``com.microsoft`` contrib op): the QDQ shape keeps the
activation's scale/zero-point and the weight's codes/scale as ordinary,
independently addressable initializers feeding standard ONNX
Quantize/DequantizeLinear nodes, exactly the "locate an initializer by the
node that consumes it, rewrite it in place" contract every onnxsim
``apply_*`` correction pass already relies on -- QGemm's fused contrib-op
inputs are no harder to *locate*, but there is no equivalent standard-ONNX
node to rewrite them through, and this module has no need to touch QGemm's
own compute node at all.

For every MatMul, or "vanilla" Gemm (``transA=0``, ``alpha=1``, ``beta=1``),
present (by node output name) in both ``float_model`` and ``quantized_model``
whose ``quantized_model`` shape matches
:func:`onnxsim.quantize_static`'s output exactly --

.. code-block:: text

    Xq  = QuantizeLinear(X, Xs, Xzp)        -- Xs/Xzp: asymmetric uint8
    Xdq = DequantizeLinear(Xq, Xs, Xzp)
    Wdq = DequantizeLinear(Wq, Ws, Wzp, axis=<W's output-channel axis>)
          -- Wzp spelled out explicitly (all zeros, same shape as Ws)
    Y   = MatMul(Xdq, Wdq)                  -- or Gemm

-- this recovers each weight element's quantization bin the same way
:mod:`onnxsim.adaround` does and optimizes a continuous rectified-sigmoid
relaxation of its floor/ceil choice, *jointly* with ``Xs``/``Xzp`` (kept
continuous during optimization, projected back to an integer zero-point in
``[0, 255]`` only at the very end), against real activations captured from
``float_model`` -- minimizing
``||X @ W_float - dequantize(quantize(X, Xs, Xzp)) @ W_hat||^2`` by a small
hand-rolled Adam loop over all three parameter groups at once. The
activation branch's gradients are the standard "straight-through" quantized-
affine gradients (as in Bengio et al.'s STE and, applied to a *learnable*
clip range specifically, Esser et al. 2019's LSQ): ``round()``'s local
gradient is taken as 1 everywhere it isn't saturated by the surrounding
clip, and the clip's own gradient is 1 (pass-through) inside the clamped
range and 0 outside it -- composed step by step through the actual
quantize-then-dequantize computation graph, not algebraically simplified
first (naively simplifying ``dequantize(quantize(x, s)) ≈ x`` under a
literal round-is-identity substitution would erase the very rounding-error
signal the scale gradient needs). The weight's own quantization *scale*
stays exactly what :func:`quantize_static` calibrated -- only which integer
each element rounds to is optimized, the same restriction
:mod:`onnxsim.adaround` already imposes and this module inherits unchanged.

    regularizer, the same Adam -- expressed so it can run on an execution
    provider instead of on the host. See :mod:`onnxsim.qat_graph` for why a
    hand-derived gradient can be written as an inference graph at all, and
    ``docs/qat.md`` for what it is for.

    The one structural difference from
    :func:`onnxsim.adaround._build_rounding_step_graph` is what the step
    updates: AdaQuant optimizes three parameter groups jointly, so there are
    three :func:`onnxsim.qat_graph.adam_update` calls (it is a per-tensor
    update) and nine state tensors -- the per-element relaxation ``v`` plus
    the two rank-0 activation parameters, each with its own pair of Adam
    moments. They share one learning rate each (``w_lr`` for the weight
    relaxation, ``a_lr`` for both activation parameters, matching the numpy
    loop's two rates) and one pair of bias corrections, since every group
    takes its first step on the same iteration.

    Critically, the quantize-then-dequantize chain is emitted as the four
    separate stages the gradient is derived through (divide, round, offset,
    clip) rather than as a ``QuantizeLinear``/``DequantizeLinear`` pair: the
    scale's gradient lives entirely in the *difference* between ``x / s`` and
    its rounded value, so a formulation that hid the rounding inside one op
    would have nothing to differentiate. This module's own docstring explains
    the same point for the numpy loop.

    Shapes are baked in at build time (``x`` is ``[num_rows, k]``, the weight
    ``[n, k]``): the accelerator backends this exists for -- WebNN and the NPU
    execution providers -- compile a graph once and want static shapes, and a
    step graph is rebuilt per layer anyway.

    ``simplify`` is forwarded to :func:`qat_graph.make_step_graph` unchanged
    -- see :func:`onnxsim.adaround._build_rounding_step_graph`'s own note on

    :func:`_optimize_adaquant_on_graph`'s own ONNX step-graph execution
    instead -- that accelerator path has no C++ port and is unaffected by
    this alias. :func:`_optimize_adaquant`/:func:`_find_static_qdq_candidates`
    themselves are untouched and stay available (the latter is a reusable
    building block :mod:`onnxsim.qat` imports directly, independent of
    whether this function still calls it) -- only this function's own
    default dispatch changed. Imported lazily (inside the function body,
    not at module scope) to avoid a circular import:
    ``onnxsim.onnx_simplifier`` already imports from this module, so

// Constant folding: partitioning a graph's nodes into foldable/non-foldable,
// running the foldable ones through a ModelExecutor, and materializing their
// outputs -- as a plain initializer when the fold traces back purely to graph
// initializers, or as a fresh Constant node otherwise (e.g. a fold that
// consumed a pre-existing Constant node's embedded value), so that
// provenance stays visible in the output model. Two parallel implementations
// live here: one that works on onnx::ModelProto (used by the legacy Simplify
// path), and a Graph-native one that walks onnx::Graph directly (see this
// file's own top-of-.cpp comment on the Graph-native section for why both
// exist).

// constant folder will normalize it -- into a plain initializer if its value
// is otherwise purely initializer-derived, exactly as if the pass had never
// represented it as a Constant node at all. Such a node must not be treated
// as a source of "not from initializers" provenance the way a genuine (user-

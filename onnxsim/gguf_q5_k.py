"""llama.cpp's GGUF "Q5_K" K-quant format -- the block layout behind the
``Q5_K_M``/``Q5_K_S`` quantization presets, the usual step up from
``Q4_K_M`` when a checkpoint can afford ~0.5 more bits per weight. Joins
:mod:`onnxsim.gguf_kquant` (Q4_K) and :mod:`onnxsim.gguf_q6_k` (Q6_K) as
this repo's third member of the K-quant family proper -- distinct from the
plainer :mod:`onnxsim.gguf_legacy_quant` (Q4_0/Q4_1, one flat scale per
block, no super-block) and :mod:`onnxsim.iq4_nl`/
:mod:`onnxsim.gguf_ternary_quant` (a fixed codebook or ternary code, not a
re-quantized affine scale).

onnxsim already *reads* Q5_K when importing a GGUF checkpoint -- see
:func:`onnxsim.import_gguf_weights` and ``onnxsim/ggml_kquant.h``'s
``DequantizeQ5_KBlock``/``GetScaleMinK4``, which this module's own
dequantization math is deliberately kept consistent with (the same
"verified against this repo's own existing decoder" discipline
:mod:`onnxsim.gguf_kquant`'s own docstring already documents). What has
been missing is the encoder direction: nothing in onnxsim could take a
float32 ONNX weight and quantize it *into* that format. This module adds
that as a plain weight-only PTQ pass -- onnxsim ports the *algorithm*, not
llama.cpp's own C code, and has no ONNX tensor type for Q5_K's own packed,
fractional (5.5-bit-per-element average) storage, so the result is
represented as an ordinary float32 quantize-dequantize round trip folded
directly into a new initializer, exactly the pattern every weight-only
``quantize_*``/``apply_*`` function in this repo already uses (no new graph
nodes needed).

**Q5_K's block structure** is Q4_K's, with one difference: a 256-element
super-block is split into 8 sub-blocks of 32, each sub-block getting its
own asymmetric affine quantizer ``dequant = q * sub_scale + sub_min``, and
the element code ``q`` is **5 bits** (``[0, 31]``) rather than Q4_K's 4
(``[0, 15]``). Everything else is identical to Q4_K: the ``sub_min`` is a
genuine (usually negative) offset rather than a symmetric zero-point, and
the 8 per-sub-block ``(scale, min)`` pairs are not stored as float32 --
each is re-quantized to a 6-bit code relative to one shared pair of
super-block-level reference values (``d``/``dmin``, stored as float16 in a
real ``.gguf`` file), so a whole 256-element super-block costs one float16
pair plus 8x2x6 bits of packed sub-scale/sub-min data. Per
``DequantizeQ5_KBlock``, sub-block ``j`` reconstructs as::

    value = d * sc_j * q - dmin * m_j,   q in [0, 31],   sc_j, m_j in [0, 63]

On disk a 5-bit code cannot sit in a nibble, so a real Q5_K block splits
each ``q`` into a 4-bit ``ql`` nibble plus one high bit pulled from a
separate 32-byte ``qh`` bitmask (hence ``(ql[l] & 0xF) + ((qh[l] & u1) ?
16 : 0)`` in the decoder). That is purely a *storage* concern: like every
sibling K-quant module here, this one reproduces only the reconstructed
float32 *values*, never the literal packed on-disk bit layout, so there is
no ``qh``/bit-packing here -- only the numeric round trip over a 5-bit code
range.

**Honesty note on exactly how this was verified** (per this repo's own
established precedent for a format ported from outside documentation
rather than from a runnable reference implementation): the
*dequantization* side of this module is transcribed directly from, and
cross-checked element-for-element against, this repository's own
``onnxsim/ggml_kquant.h`` (``DequantizeQ5_KBlock``/``GetScaleMinK4``),
which is itself transcribed from GGML's own ``ggml-quants.c`` reference.
That gives a verified value for what a Q5_K block *means* -- the formula
above, i.e. ``sub_scale_j = d*sc_j`` and ``sub_min_j = -(dmin*m_j)`` in the
``q*sub_scale + sub_min`` form. This module's
:func:`_quantize_dequantize_superblocks` reproduces exactly that
reconstruction formula. What is **not** independently verified against real
``ggml`` source is llama.cpp's own *encoder* -- ``quantize_row_q5_K``'s
exact procedure for choosing each sub-block's ideal (scale, min) and
requantizing them to 6 bits (e.g. whether it uses a plain min/max affine
fit or a weighted least-squares search) was not available to read
alongside ``ggml_kquant.h``'s decoder. This module's encoder therefore
uses the same straightforward, honestly-scoped mechanism
:mod:`onnxsim.gguf_kquant`'s Q4_K encoder already established -- an
ordinary per-sub-block min/max affine fit, then requantizing each
sub-block's scale/min to a 6-bit code relative to the super-block's own
largest scale/min (so the largest sub-block scale/min maps to the top of
the 6-bit range, matching what a shared-reference-pair scheme requires) --
rather than a byte-exact reproduction of llama.cpp's own encoder.
``tests/test_gguf_q5_k.py`` verifies with real numpy arithmetic (not
recalled/assumed constants) that this mechanism actually behaves like a
K-quant is supposed to: block-wise affine quantization with a re-quantized
per-sub-block (scale, min) reduces reconstruction error versus a naive
single-scale-per-256-element quantizer, and Q5_K's wider code range never
reconstructs worse than Q4_K's own encoder on the same data.

**Scope**: matches ``MatMul``/"vanilla" ``Gemm`` (via
:func:`onnxsim.llm_int8._match_matmul_like`, shared with several other
onnxsim modules) and, optionally, ``Conv`` -- any constant float32 weight,
of any rank, is flattened, zero-padded up to a whole number of 256-element
super-blocks, quantized, and reshaped back; padding elements are quantized
along with the rest but discarded before reshaping, so they cannot affect
the tensor's real values (only, very slightly, a boundary sub-block's own
chosen scale/min, for tensors whose element count isn't itself a multiple
of 32). No calibration data is needed -- every quantization decision comes
from the weight tensor's own values.

"""Real, multi-process data-parallel training over onnxsim's own step-graph
machinery -- see ``docs/distributed-data-parallel-plan.md`` for the design
rationale and why this stays deliberately scoped to data parallelism rather
than tensor/pipeline parallelism.

**The split this module makes that no other onnxsim training path needs.**
:func:`onnxsim.qat_graph.make_step_graph` fuses forward, backward, and an
optimizer update into one graph for every existing caller
(:mod:`onnxsim.lora`, :mod:`onnxsim.qat`), because every existing caller
trains alone. Data-parallel training needs a gradient *average* to happen
between backward and the optimizer step, so this module splits those two
into separate graphs instead:

- :func:`build_gradient_step_graph` -- forward, an MSE loss, and
  :func:`onnxsim.graph_grad.build_backward` restricted to the parameters
  being trained. No optimizer, no state threading: a worker's weights are
  fed fresh from the parent process every step (see
  :func:`train_data_parallel`), never carried between calls.
- :func:`build_apply_step_graph` -- exactly the same
  :func:`onnxsim.qat_graph.adam_update`-as-a-step-graph idiom every other
  onnxsim training path already uses, just fed an already-averaged gradient
  instead of one it computed itself.

**The orchestration.** :func:`train_data_parallel` spawns one real OS
process per data shard (``multiprocessing.Process``, not a thread or an
in-process loop), each running its own ``onnxruntime`` session on the
gradient-step graph against its own private data; the parent process
collects every worker's gradients over a ``multiprocessing.Pipe``, averages
them, and runs the (single, shared) apply-step to produce the next round's
weights, which it broadcasts back down the same pipes. This is genuine
inter-process parallelism -- unlike :mod:`onnxsim.federated`'s sequential
simulation of federated clients, or ``scripts/distributed_tp_sketch.py``'s
single-process numpy stand-in for NCCL -- it just runs on one machine's CPU
cores rather than a GPU cluster or a real network, since that is what is
available to develop and test this against. See the plan doc's "Left for
later" section for what a real multi-node transport would need to change
(the gradient-averaging math here would not).

"""One optimizer step, expressed as an ONNX graph, so it can run wherever an
ONNX model can run -- CPU, CUDA/ROCm (including MIGraphX), an NPU execution
provider, or WebGPU in a browser -- instead of only in host numpy.

Six passes in this repo (:mod:`onnxsim.adaround`, :mod:`onnxsim.adaquant`,
:mod:`onnxsim.brecq`, :mod:`onnxsim.flexround`, :mod:`onnxsim.autoround`,
:mod:`onnxsim.omniquant`) already optimize a quantization parameter by Adam
with hand-derived, straight-through gradients. Every one of them runs that
loop in host numpy: their ``providers=`` argument reaches only the *capture*
of calibration activations from the float model, never the optimization
itself. That is the whole gap this module closes, and the reason it can be
closed cheaply is the "hand-derived" part:

    **A hand-derived backward pass is ordinary dataflow.** There is no tape,
    no autograd framework, and no ``Gradient`` operator involved -- just
    ``MatMul``/``Mul``/``Sub``/``Sigmoid``/``Clip``/``Sqrt`` over tensors. So
    it is expressible as a plain ONNX *inference* graph, and any runtime that
    can do inference can therefore train these parameters.

A **step graph** is that expression: a pure function

.. code-block:: text

    (fixed constants, mutable state, per-step scalars) -> (next state, loss)

with the optimizer's own state (Adam's two moments) carried in and out as
tensors rather than held in Python. Running it ``N`` times, feeding each
call's state outputs back in as the next call's state inputs
(:func:`run_step_graph`), *is* the optimization loop -- and it happens
wherever the execution provider says.

**What this buys, concretely.** :class:`onnxsim.backend.Runner` binds the
graph and a provider list once, so the same builder reaches
``CUDAExecutionProvider``, the ROCm ``ROCMExecutionProvider`` /
``MIGraphXExecutionProvider`` pair (see ``scripts/amd/README.md``) or an NPU
EP (QNN, Core ML, OpenVINO -- see the harnesses under ``scripts/``) from
Python, and in the browser the WASM
build's model-executor trampoline (``docs/wasm_ort_web.md``) hands the same
graph to onnxruntime-web, whose provider list already offers ``webgpu`` and
WebNN's ``gpu``/``npu`` device types (``docs/webnn.md``).

The tensors also *stay* where that provider put them. :func:`run_step_graph`
binds the graph's constants and its state through onnxruntime's ``IOBinding``
(``bind_state=True``, the default, via
:meth:`onnxsim.backend.Runner.bind_loop`): the calibration activations are
uploaded once at setup, each step's state outputs become the next step's state
inputs without a round trip through host numpy, and only the per-step scalars
go up and the loss comes down. On CPU that saves a memcpy or two; on a
provider whose bus is PCIe it is the difference between a loop that is
arithmetic and a loop that is transfers.

**Minibatching, and where the batch lives.** A step graph's shapes are
static, so "the batch" is a fixed-size tensor either way; the question a
minibatched loop has to answer is where the *rest* of the data sits between
steps. Two answers, and this module implements the first:

- **The whole set stays resident and the graph selects rows.** The
  calibration set is one constant, uploaded once by ``bind_loop`` exactly as
  before, and each step feeds a rank-1 int64 index vector that a ``Gather``
  turns into that step's rows (:meth:`GraphBuilder.gather_rows`,
  :func:`minibatch_indices`). Per-step traffic stays at "a few scalars up, a
  loss down" -- ``batch_size`` int64s is not a transfer -- so the residency
  argument above survives a batch that changes every step. What it costs:
  one operator in :data:`EP_FRIENDLY_OPS` that is not arithmetic (see the
  note there for why ``Gather`` clears that bar where ``Round`` does not),
  a few nodes of graph, and the fact that the *set* must still fit in one
  static tensor on the device. Minibatching this way buys per-step compute
  and stochastic-gradient behaviour, not a larger-than-memory dataset.
- **The batch's rows are fed per step.** No new operator, no resident set,
  and no limit at all on how much data a run may stream -- but
  ``batch_size x width`` floats cross the bus every step, which is the exact
  cost :meth:`onnxsim.backend.Runner.bind_loop` was written to remove. The
  seam is open (``run_step_graph``'s ``feeds``, which is what carries the
  index vector in the chosen design), and its docstring records when this
  second answer would be the right one; a calibration set is small and a
  PCIe round trip per step is not, so it is not the default.

**What it does not buy, and the honest limits.**

- *Residency is the Python half only.* ``IOBinding`` covers onnxruntime in
  Python. The browser half of the same idea -- ORT-web's GPU-buffer tensors
  with ``preferredOutputLocation: "gpu-buffer"``, fed straight back in as the
  next step's inputs -- is still to do, so the WASM path re-sends its feeds
  every step.
- *Precision.* Step graphs are built in float32, not the float64 the numpy
  loops use: fp64 is what accelerators do not have. Results therefore agree
  with the numpy path closely rather than bit-exactly.
- *Determinism.* A non-CPU provider reassociates reductions, so a trained
  result is not reproducible the way ``tests/test_constant_fold_determinism.py``
  requires of folding. CPU stays the default everywhere in-tree.

See ``docs/qat.md`` for how this fits the larger QAT picture.

# requires, rather than whatever the installed onnx's newest opset needs.
_OPSET = 17
_IR_VERSION = 8

# The operator set a step graph restricts itself to.
#
# The point of expressing a training step as an ONNX graph is that it runs
# wherever inference runs -- including onnxruntime-web's WebGPU backend and
# the WebNN/NPU execution providers, which implement far less than the full
# ONNX operator set. A step graph that reached for a convenient operator one
# of those cannot run would pass every numerical test and still be useless
# for the thing this module exists for, so the ops a builder may emit are
# pinned here and asserted in tests (``tests/test_qat_graph.py``,
# ``tests/test_graph_grad.py``, ``tests/test_adaquant_step_graph.py``).
#
# What is deliberately absent: control flow, boolean logic ops (a mask is a
# float 0/1 from ``Cast(Greater(...))``, multiplied in), ``Where``,
# ``Expand``, and ``Round`` -- which :mod:`onnxsim.adaquant` composes out of
# ``Sign``/``Abs``/``Cast`` instead. That composition was written when WebNN
# had no rounding operator at all; it has since gained ``roundEven``, and
# onnxruntime-web's WebNN EP maps ``Round`` onto it, so the reason has
# weakened rather than held. See the ``Conv`` note below, which is where that
# was re-checked and what it was checked against.
# Adding to this set is a real decision: check the operator actually has
# coverage on the WebGPU and WebNN backends first, not just on ORT's CPU
# kernels.
#
# ``Gather`` is the one addition made for a reason other than arithmetic, and
# it earns its place on exactly that criterion rather than on convenience.
# It is what lets a step graph read a *minibatch* out of a resident
# calibration set (:meth:`GraphBuilder.gather_rows`, and see
# :func:`minibatch_indices` for the loop around it): the whole set is uploaded
# once as a constant and the step selects rows from it by an index vector, so
# nothing large crosses the bus per step. The coverage is real on both
# backends this list exists for -- WebNN specifies ``gather`` (unlike
# ``round``, which it has no operator for at all, the case that shaped the
# rest of this list), and onnxruntime-web's WebGPU EP implements ``Gather``;
# it is also among the first ops every NPU EP in ``scripts/`` supports, since
# embedding lookup is inference, not training. The alternative that needed no
# new operator -- feeding the batch's rows themselves as a per-step input --
# is rejected in :func:`run_step_graph`'s own docstring, where the trade-off
# it loses is spelled out.
#
# ``Conv`` and ``ConvTranspose`` were considered for this set and deliberately
# left out, which is worth recording because the case for them looks strong:
# :func:`onnxsim.graph_grad._grad_conv` differentiates a convolution, and the
# textbook way to write that backward is a ``ConvTranspose`` for ``dX`` and a
# ``Conv`` over permuted axes for ``dW``. Both operators do have coverage --
# onnxruntime-web's WebGPU EP lists ``Conv`` and ``ConvTranspose``, and its
# WebNN EP maps them onto WebNN's ``conv2d``/``convTranspose2d`` -- so the
# membership test above is not what refuses them. What refuses them is the
# shape of that coverage:
#
# - It is 2-D only, on *both* backends. The WebGPU EP's own operator table
#   annotates ``Conv`` with "conv3d is not supported" and ``ConvTranspose``
#   with "ConvTranspose3d is not supported"; the WebNN EP's table restricts
#   both to "3-D or 4-D input and 'W'", and the WebNN specification defines
#   ``conv2d`` and ``convTranspose2d`` and no other convolution at all
#   ("Compute a 2-D convolution given 4-D input and filter tensors"). A rule
#   emitting them would therefore be a rule that runs for a 2-D convolution
#   and is dead in the browser for a 3-D one, which is precisely the failure
#   this list exists to prevent -- and a *silent* one, since the graph would
#   still be valid ONNX and still run on CPU.
# - ``dW``-as-a-``Conv`` is not attribute-for-attribute the forward: it swaps
#   strides with dilations and, when the stride does not divide the input,
#   needs its result cropped -- a ``Slice``, which is a second new member.
#   ``dX``-as-a-``ConvTranspose`` needs ``output_shape`` for the same reason.
#
# So ``_grad_conv`` is written as im2col instead -- one ``Gather`` with a
# constant index, one ``Mul`` by a 0/1 mask, one ``MatMul`` -- which adds
# nothing to this set, is rank-agnostic (1-D, 2-D and 3-D convolutions
# differentiate identically), and stays inside the ranks the WebNN spec
# *requires* implementations to support: its ``gather`` states allowed input
# rank 1 to N with 1 to 5 required, and its ``matmul`` "2 to N" with "2 to 5"
# required, against the rank-4 tensors that rule emits. What it costs instead
# is memory -- a materialized index table per convolution -- which is stated
# where the rule pays it rather than here.
#
# Sources checked when this was written (September 2026), rather than
# remembered: onnxruntime's ``js/web/docs/webgpu-operators.md`` and
# ``js/web/docs/webnn-operators.md`` on ``main``, and the WebNN
# specification's operator definitions. One thing they say that the paragraph
# above this one no longer does: WebNN today *has* gained a rounding
# operator (``roundEven``, which the WebNN EP maps ``Round`` onto). The
# composition in :mod:`onnxsim.adaquant` is not therefore wrong, but its
# reason has weakened, and this note is here so the next person to reach for
# ``Round`` re-checks rather than trusting the older sentence.

    ``(param', mom')``.

    ``mom`` is a single exponential moving average of the gradient -- unlike
    Adam's ``m``/``v`` pair, there is no second moment estimating the
    gradient's variance, so there is nothing here that plays ``v``'s role and
    nothing to bias-correct against it. The update is textbook heavy-ball
    momentum::

        mom' = momentum * mom + grad
        param' = param - lr * mom'

    ``momentum`` is a plain Python float baked into the graph as a constant
    with :meth:`GraphBuilder.shared_const`, exactly like ``eps`` in
    :func:`adam_update` -- not a per-step scalar input the way ``lr`` is.
    This is a real, deliberate limitation rather than an oversight: a step
    graph built with this function can anneal ``lr`` from one step to the
    next (it is fed fresh every call to :func:`run_step_graph`), but
    ``momentum`` is fixed for the life of the graph -- changing it means
    building a new step graph.
    Nothing in this optimizer's current callers needs a per-step momentum
    schedule, and keeping it a constant keeps the graph one input smaller.

    No bias correction is needed here the way :func:`adam_update` needs
    ``m_correction``/``v_correction``. Adam corrects because ``m``/``v`` are
    *initialized at zero* and an EMA started at zero is biased low for its
    first few steps in proportion to how fast it decays -- ``v``'s bias
    matters more because it sits under a square root and a division, so an
    underestimate there inflates the step size right when the estimate is
    least reliable. Plain heavy-ball momentum has the same zero-init warm-up
    (``mom`` is biased low for its first few steps too), but that bias shows up
    linearly, inside a term that is merely *added* to the gradient and then
    scaled by ``lr`` -- there is no division or square root downstream to
    amplify it into instability, so callers of this optimizer accept the
    same slow warm-up plain SGD momentum has always had rather than paying
    for a correction the algebra does not need.

    Uses only :meth:`GraphBuilder.shared_const`/:meth:`add`/:meth:`mul`/
    :meth:`sub` -- no ``div``/``sqrt``, since there is no second moment or
    epsilon-guarded denominator to compute.

            which of the two shapes of minibatching a caller gets depends

            - **An index vector into a resident set** (what
              :func:`onnxsim.apply_qat` does, via
              :meth:`GraphBuilder.gather_rows` and
              :func:`minibatch_indices`). The whole calibration set stays in
              ``constants``, uploaded once and never re-sent; the step graph
              selects its own rows. Per-step traffic is ``batch_size``
              int64s, which is nothing, and the residency this module is
              built around survives a batch that changes every step. The
              price is that the *set* still has to fit in one static tensor
              on the device: minibatching this way buys per-step compute
              (a step's FLOPs scale with the batch, not with the set) and
              stochastic-gradient behaviour, not a larger-than-memory set.
            - **The batch's rows themselves.** Then ``constants`` holds
              nothing large, the set can live in host memory or be streamed
              from disk, and the cap on how much data a run may use goes
              away entirely -- at the cost of copying ``batch_size x width``
              floats to the device on every single step, which is precisely
              the transfer :meth:`onnxsim.backend.Runner.bind_loop` exists to

    """The row indices step ``t`` should train on, as a pure function of ``t``.

    Feed the result to :func:`run_step_graph`'s ``feeds`` and the graph's own
    :meth:`GraphBuilder.gather_rows` and the loop is minibatched: the whole
    calibration set stays resident as a constant, and each step reads
    ``batch_size`` of its rows.

    Three decisions live here, and each of them is a decision rather than an
    accident:

    **The stream is an endless concatenation of permutations, chopped into
    fixed-size chunks.** Step ``t`` gets stream positions
    ``[t*B, (t+1)*B)``; position ``p`` is row ``perm[p // N][p % N]``, where
    ``perm[e]`` is epoch ``e``'s ordering of the ``N`` rows. So every row is
    visited exactly once per ``N`` positions consumed, no matter where the
    batch boundaries fall.

    **What happens when the batch size does not divide the row count**: the
    batch that would run off the end of an epoch is *completed from the front
    of the next epoch's permutation*, rather than being short. It has to be:
    a step graph's shapes are static -- that is the property that lets it
    compile for an NPU and lets :meth:`onnxsim.backend.Runner.bind_loop`
    pre-allocate its buffers -- so a ragged final batch would need a second
    graph, and every alternative that keeps one graph is worse. Dropping the
    tail (PyTorch's ``drop_last``) would silently discard up to
    ``batch_size - 1`` rows per epoch, and *systematically* the same rows
    whenever ``shuffle=False``. Padding by repeating a row would quietly
    reweight it. Wrapping keeps every row's visit count equal and every batch
    full; its only cost is that a straddling batch can contain the same row
    twice, when that row lands near the end of one permutation and the start
    of the next, which weights it double in that one step and not at all
    thereafter.

    **Shuffling and the seed.** ``shuffle=True`` draws a fresh permutation per
    epoch, which is what makes consecutive steps see different rows rather
    than the same ``B`` rows forever -- without it, an epoch's batches are
    the same fixed partition every time round and the "stochastic" in
    stochastic gradient descent is only the partition, never the composition.
    The permutation for epoch ``e`` is drawn from ``(seed, e)`` alone, not
    from a running generator, so this stays a pure function of ``t``: two runs
    with the same seed see identical batches, and (like the step graph itself)
    a loop can be stopped after ``N`` steps and resumed at step ``N`` without
    the batch order shifting. ``shuffle=False`` walks the rows in order, which
    is what a test that wants to see the batch composition directly, or a
    caller whose rows are already in a meaningful order, should use.

    :param num_rows: rows in the resident calibration set
    :param batch_size: rows per step. Larger than ``num_rows`` is allowed and
            simply means the wrap repeats rows within one batch, but callers
            normally clamp to the set size instead -- at that point the batch
            *is* the set and the full-batch path is both cheaper and exact.
    :param seed: seed for the per-epoch permutations
    :param shuffle: draw a new permutation per epoch instead of walking the
            rows in order
